For hands-on training, we will use the macro module Filter, which was created in the previous chapter.\nDepending on the way the macro module was created the default help page and example network might or might not exist. In case they exist, the help page only contains information about module in- and outputs as well as module fields. The example network only contains the macro module itself. Both, the help page and the example network, can be created and edited after module creation.\nSteps to do Creation of help files using MeVisLab MATE We will start by creating a help file using the build in text editor MeVisLab MATE (MeVisLab Advanced Text Editor). If you open the context menu of your global macro module and select [ Help ], it might be, that no help page is given. We will start to create a help file by selecting [ Help \u0026rarr; Create Help ]. If a help page already exists, select [ Help \u0026rarr; Edit Help ].\nCreation of module help MeVisLab MATE opens. An .mhelp file (Filter.mhelp) is created automatically and is stored in the folder your macro module Filter is stored in. You can find the folder structure in MATE on the left side. Editing the text field, you can edit the help file.\nEdit module help file via MATE When creating the help file of a module, all important information of the module down to the field specifications are extracted and created automatically. Thus, the basic module information is always available in the module help. Additional documentation should be added by the module author. On the left side, you can find the outline of the help file. Each section can be edited. In this example, we added the purpose of the module to the help file.\nEdit module help file via MATE MATE offers the possibility to format the text. By using the button M, module names can be formatted in such a way that links to the respective help file of the modules are created.\nEdit module help file via MATE After finishing your documentation, you can click Generate Help or F7 and your final help file is generated.\nExtra Infos:\u0026nbsp; More information on MeVisLab MATE can be found here\nThe Module Help Editor is explained here\nThe result can be seen when opening the help file via context menu in MeVisLab IDE (or by pressing F1 ).\nHelp file of the module Watch out:\u0026nbsp; Depending on the way the macro module was created, more or less features are automatically given in the help file and the example network. All missing features can be added manually. Creation of an example network To add an example network to your module, you need to add a reference to the respective .mlab file to the module definition file (.def). Open the file Filter.def. You can find the line exampleNetwork = \u0026ldquo;$(LOCAL)/networks/FilterExample.mlab\u0026rdquo;, which defines the reference to the .mlab file containing the example network. Per default the name of the example network is ModulenameExample.mlab. An .mlab file containing only the module Filter is created insight the folder networks.\nIt is possible that the reference to the example network or the file FilterExample.mlab is missing. One reason could be, that its creation was not selected when creating the macro module. In this case, add the reference and the file manually.\nReference to Example Network To create the example network, open the file FilterExample.mlab in MeVisLab and create an appropriate example.\nExample Network Summary MeVisLab MATE is a build-in text editor which can be used to create module help files, module panels or to create module interactionss via Python scripting. You can create help files via the module context menu using MeVisLab Mate. You can add an example network to your macro module via the .def file ","tags":["Beginner","Tutorial","Macro","Macro Modules","Global Macro","Help"],"section":"tutorials"},{"date":"1655276324","url":"https://mevislab.github.io/examples/tutorials/basicmechanisms/macromodules/guidesign/","title":"Example 2.4: GUI development","summary":"Example 2.4: Building a Panel Layout: Interactions with Macro Modules \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;This example is also available on YouTube.

For the implementation you will need to use the MeVisLab Definition Language (MDL) .\nExtra Infos:\u0026nbsp; More information about GUI design in MeVisLab can be found here Creating a panel for the macro module flilter Creation of a module panel In Example 2.2 we created the global macro module Filter. By now, this module does not have a proper panel. When double-clicking the module, the Automatic Panel is shown.\nThe Automatic Panel contains fields, as well as module in and outputs. In this case, no fields exists except the instanceName. Accordingly, there is no possibility to interact with the module. Only the input and the output of the module are given.\nAutomatic Panel To add and edit a panel, open the context menu and select [ Related Files \u0026rarr; Filter.script ]. The text-editor MATE opens. You can see the file Filter.script, which you can edit to define a custom User Interface for the Module.\nModule script file Module interface Per default, the .script file contains the interface of the module. In the interface section (everything insight the curled brackets behind the name Interface) you can define the module inputs, the module outputs and also all module fields (or Parameters).\nFilter.script\nInterface { Inputs { Field input0 { internalName = Convolution.input0 } } Outputs { Field output0 { internalName = Arithmetic2.output0 } } } Module inputs and outputs To create an input/output, you need to define a Field in the respective input/output environment. Each input/output gets a name (here input0/output0) which you can use to reference this field. The module input maps to an input of the internal network. You need to define this mapping. In this case the input of the macro module Filter maps to the input of the module Convolution of the internal network (internalName = Convolution.input0). Similarly, you need to define which output of the internal network maps to the output of the macro module Filter. In this example, the output of the internal module Arithmethic2 maps to the output of our macro module Filter (internalName = Arithmetic2.output0).\nCreating an input/output causes:\nInput/output connectors are added to the module. You can find placeholders for the input and output in the internal network (see image). Input/output fields are added to the automatic panel. A description of the input/output fields is automatically added to the module help file, when opening the .mhelp file after input/output creation. Helpfile creation is explained in Example 2.3. Internal Network of your macro module Module fields In the environment Parameters you can define fields of your macro module. These fields may map to existing fields of the internal network (internalName = \u0026hellip; ), but they do not need to and can also be completely new. You can reference these fields when creating a panel, to allow interactions with these fields. All fields appear in the Automatic Panel.\nModule panel layout To create your own User Interface, we need to create a Window . A window is one of the layout elements which exist in MDL. These layout elements are called controls . The curled brackets define the window environment, in which you can define properties of the window and insert further controls like a Box .\nInitially, we call the window MyWindowTitle, which can be used to reference this window.\nDouble-clicking on your Module now opens your first self developed User Interface.\nFilter.script\nInterface { Inputs { Field input0 { internalName = Convolution.input0 } } Outputs { Field output0 { internalName = Arithmetic2.output0 } } Parameters { } } Window MyWindowName { title = MyWindowTitle Box MyBox { } } Module Panel You can define different properties of your control. For a window, you can for example define a title, or whether the window should be shown in full screen (fullscreen = True).\nThese properties are called tags and are individually different for each control. Which tags exist for the control window can be found here . The control box has different tags. You can for example define a title for the box, but you can not define whether to present the box in full screen.\nIf you like to add more than one control to your window, for example one box and one label, you can specify their design like in the following examples:\nFilter.script\nWindow MyWindowName { title = MyWindowTitle w = 100 h = 50 Vertical { Box MyBox { title = \u0026#34;Title of my Box\u0026#34; } Label MyLabel { title = \u0026#34;This is a label below the box\u0026#34; } } } Vertical layout of Box and Text Filter.script\nWindow MyWindowName { title = MyWindowTitle w = 100 h = 50 Horizontal { Box MyBox { title = \u0026#34;Title of my Box\u0026#34; } Label MyLabel { title = \u0026#34;This is a label below the box\u0026#34; } } } Horizontal layout of Box and Text There are much more controls, which can be used. For example a CheckBox, a Table, a Grid, a Button, ... . To find out more, take a look into the MDL Reference .\nModule interactions Until now, we learned how to create the layout of a panel. As a next step, we like to get an overview over interactions.\nExtra Infos:\u0026nbsp; You can add the Module GUIExample to your workspace and play around with is. Access to existing fields of the internal network To interact with fields of the internal network in your User Interface, we need to access these fields. To access the field of the internal module Convolution, which defines the kernel, we need to use the internal network name. To find the internal field name, open the internal network of the macro module Filter (click on the module using the middle mouse button ).\nThen, open the panel of the module Convolution and right-click the field title Use of the box Predefined Kernel and select Copy Name. You now copied the internal network name of the field to your clipboard. The name is made up of ModuleName.FieldName, in this case Convolution.predefKernel.\nConvolution Module In the panel of the module Convolution, you can change this variable Kernel via a drop-down menu. In MDL a drop-down menu is called a ComboBox . We can take over the field predefKernel, its drop-down menu and all its properties by creating a new field in our panel and reference to the internal field Convolution.predefKernel, which already exist in the internal network.\nChanges of the properties of this field can be done in the curled brackets using tags (here, we changed the title).\nFilter.script\nWindow MyWindowName { title = MyWindowTitle Field Convolution.predefKernel { title = Kernel } } Selecting the kernel As an alternative, you can define the field kernel in the Parameters environment, and reference the defined field by its name. The result in the panel is the same. You can see a difference in the Automatic Panel. All fields, which are defined in the interface in the Parameters environment appear in the Automatic Panel. Fields of the internal network, which are used but not declared in the section Parameters of the module interface do not appear in the Automatic Panel.\nFilter.script\nInterface { Inputs { Field input0 { internalName = Convolution.input0 } } Outputs { Field output0 { internalName = Arithmetic2.output0 } } Parameters { Field kernel { internalName = Convolution.predefKernel title = Kernel: } } } Window MyWindowName { title = MyWindowTitle Field kernel {} } Commands We can not only use existing functionalities, but also add new interactions via Python scripting.\nIn below example we added a wakeupCommand to the Window and a simple command to the Button.\nFilter.script\nWindow MyWindowName { title = MyWindowTitle wakeupCommand = myWindowCommand Button MyButton { command = myButtonAction } } The wakeupCommand defines a Python function which is executed as soon as the Window is opened. The Button command is executed when the user clicks on the Button.\nBoth commands reference a Python function which is executed whenever both actions (open the Window or click the Button) are executed.\nIf you like to learn more about Python scripting, take a look at Example 2.5.\nWe need to define the Python script, which contains our Python functions. In order to do this, add a Command section outside your window and define the tag source.\nExample: Filter.script\nCommands { source = $(LOCAL)/Filter.py } Infos:\u0026nbsp; The section Source should already be available and generated automatically in case you enable the Wizard to add a Python file to your Module. You can right-click on the command (myWindowCommand or myButtonAction) in your .script file and select [ Create Python Funtion...... ]. The text editor MATE opens automatically and generates an initial Python function for you. You can simply add a logging function or implement complex logic here.\nExample: Filter.py\ndef myWindowCommand: MLAB.log(\u0026#34;Window opened\u0026#34;) def myButtonAction: MLAB.log(\u0026#34;Button clicked\u0026#34;) Summary User interfaces and several module panels can be created for each macro module. You can create a panel, define in and outputs as well as interactions, in your .script file in MATE by using the MeVisLab Definition Language (MDL) . Module interactions can be implemented using commands, which are linked to Python functions. You can implement fieldlisteners, which trigger actions after a field value changes. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Download .mlab file here.

But, much more important: You can access module inputs and outputs, as well as module fields to process their parameters and data. You can equip user interfaces and panel with custom functionalities. Python can be used to implement module interactions. When you open a panel or you press a button in a panel, the executed actions are implement via Python scripting.\nBasics To see how to access modules, fields, and so on, open the Scripting Console Via [ Scripting \u0026rarr; Show Scripting Console ].\nInternal field names You can find the internal name of one module field in the respective network. Open a panel, for example the Automatic Panle and right-click the field\u0026rsquo;s title to open the field\u0026rsquo;s context menu. Now, you can select Copy Name, to copy the internal name of the field. This name can be used to access the field via scripting.\nScripting context When entering ctx to the console, you can see the context you are working with. In the context of the Scripting Console, you have access to your workspace, meaning the whole network, its modules and the module fields.\nScripting context Editing the workspace In the Scripting Console, you can add and connect modules using the following commands:\nctx.addModule(\u0026quot;\u0026lt; ModuleName \u0026gt;\u0026quot;) : Add the desired module to your workspace. ctx.field(\u0026quot; \u0026lt; ModuleName.FieldName\u0026gt; \u0026quot;) : Access a field of a module. ctx.field(\u0026quot; \u0026lt; ModuleInput \u0026gt; \u0026quot;).conntectFrom(\u0026quot; \u0026lt; ModuleOutput \u0026gt; \u0026quot;) : Draw a connection from one module\u0026rsquo;s output to another module\u0026rsquo;s input. In this case we added the modules DicomImport and View2D to the workspace and connected both modules.\nAdd and connect modules via scripting It is also possible to add notes to your workspace.\nAdd a note to your workspace Access modules and module fields You can access modules via ctx.module(\u0026quot; \u0026lt; ModuleName \u0026gt; \u0026quot;). From this object, you can access module fields, module inputs and outputs and everything in context of this module.\nYou can also directly access a module field via ctx.field(\u0026quot; \u0026lt; ModuleName.FieldName \u0026gt; \u0026quot;). Different methods can be called on this object. Take a look at the Scripting Reference to find out which methods can be called for which object or class. You can for example access the value of the respective field.\nAccess modules and module fields Python Scripting Reference Here , you can find the Scripting Reference. In the Scripting Reference you can find information about different Python classes used in MeVisLab and their methods.\nWhere and how to use Python scripting Scripting View Under [ View \u0026rarr; Views \u0026rarr; Scripting ] you can find the View Scripting. The view offers a standard Python console, without any meaningful network or module context. This means only general Python functionalities can be tested and used. Access to modules or your network is not possible.\nScripting Console You can open the Scripting Console via [ Scripting \u0026rarr; Show Scripting Console ]. In the context of your workspace, you can access your network and modules.\nScripting console of modules Every module offers a scripting console. Open the context menu of a module and select [ Show Window \u0026rarr; Scripting Console ]. You can work in the context (ctx.) of this module.\nModule RunPythonScript The module RunPythonScript allows to execute Python scripts from within a MeVisLab network. You can draw parameter connection from modules to RunPythonScript and back, to process parameter fields using Python scripting. An example for the usage of RunPythonScript can be found here.\nModule interactions via Python scripting You can reference to a Python function inside a .script file of a macro module. With this, you can for example execute a Python function, whenever you open a panel, define the action which is executed when pressing a button or specify the command triggered by a field listener. An example for module interactions via Python scripting is given here.\nTips and tricks Scripting Assistant Under [ View \u0026rarr; Views \u0026rarr; Scripting Assistant ] you can find the view Scripting Assistant. In this view, the actions you execute in the workspace are translated into Python script.\nFor example: Open the Scripting Assistant. Add the module WEMInitialize to your workspace. You can select a Model, for example the cube. In addition, you can change the Translation and press Apply. All these actions can be seen in the Scripting Assistant, translated into Python code. Therefore, the Scripting Assistant is a powerful tool to help you to script you actions.\nScripting Assistant Examples See the following examples for Python Scripting:\nThe module RunPythonScript Module interactions via Python scripting Summary Python can be used to access, create and process networks, modules, fields and panels.

Add this code:\nIsoCSOs.py\nimport random red = TimeCounter * random.randrange(0,52)/255 green = TimeCounter * random.randrange(0,52)/255 blue = TimeCounter * random.randrange(0,52)/255 updateOutputValue(\u0026#34;DiffuseColor\u0026#34;, str(red) + \u0026#34; \u0026#34; + str(green) + \u0026#34; \u0026#34; + str(blue)) To update the output field DiffuseColor, it is important to use the methods updateOutputValue(name, value) or setOutputValue(name, value) instead of simply assigning a value to the output field.\nYou can now see a color change in the viewer SoExaminerViewer every time the TimeCounter counts.\nTriggered color change Summary The module RunPythonScript can be used to process module fields in your network using Python scripting. Use the methods updateOutputValue(name, value) or setOutputValue(name, value) to update output fields of RunPythonScript.

The network used in Chapter V will be used for creating the Macro Module.\nSteps to do Creating the macro module First, we condense the example network into a macro module and then we create a panel for that module. To create a macro module use the Project Wizard, which you find under [ File \u0026rarr; Run Project Wizard ]. Select Macro Module and press Run.\nNow, you have to edit:\nName: The name of your module Package: Select the package you like to save the macro module in. Directory Structure: Change to Self-contained Project: Select you project name Press Next and edit the following:\nCopy existing network: Select the example network Check the box: Add Python file Now, create your macro module and reload MeVisLab. You can find your module via search in MeVisLab.\nCreating macro module Enable Python scripting To design a panel and create a user interface for the macro module, open the .script file. You can see, that a Command environment exist, which defines the python file as source for all commands.\nOpen the script file Script file Creating a panel with tabs and viewers At first, we create a Window with two Tabs . One Main tab, in which both viewers of the network are represented and one tab for Settings. For generating tabs, we can use the control TabView , with its items TabViewItem . The control TabView enables to add a command, which is executed when opening the tab. For adding the viewers to the panel, we use the Control Viewer.\nIsoCSOs.script\nWindow { TabView { TabViewItem Main { Horizontal { Viewer View2D.self { type = SoRenderArea pw = 400 ph = 400 } Viewer SoExaminerViewer.self { type = SoExaminerViewer pw = 400 ph = 400 } } } TabViewItem Settings { } } } Panel with Tabs and Viewers Edit viewer settings in the panel You may want to change the design setting of the right viewer. This is still possible via the internal network of the macro module. Open the internal network either via the context menu or using the middle mouse button and click on the module. After that, open the Automatic Panel of the module SoExaminerViewer via context menu [ Show Windows \u0026rarr; Automatic Panel ] and change the field decoration to False. Keep in mind, as we did not create CSOs by now, the right viewer stays black.\nChange viewer settings Changed viewer settings Selection of images Next, we like to add the option to browse through the folders and select the image, we like to create CSOs from. This functionality is already given in the internal network in the module LocalImage. We can copy this functionality from LocalImage and add this option to the panel above both viewers. But, how should we know, which field name we reference to? To find this out, open the internal network of your macro module. Now you are able to open the panel of the module LocalImage. Right-click the desired field: In this case, right-click the label Name:. Select Copy Name, to copy the internal name of this field.\nCopy the field name Now, you can add this field as a new field to your window by pasting the name. All field settings are taken over from the internal field from the module LocalImage.\nIsoCSOs.script\nWindow { TabView { TabViewItem Main { Vertical { Field LocalImage.name {} Horizontal { Viewer View2D.self { type = SoRenderArea pw = 400 ph = 400 } Viewer SoExaminerViewer.self { type = SoExaminerViewer pw = 400 ph = 400 } } } } TabViewItem Settings { } } } Add name field Add buttons to your panel As a next step, we like to add a Browse...-Button, like in the module LocalImage, and also a button to create the CSOs.\nTo create the Browse...-Button:\nCreate a button containing the command fileDialog. Right-click the command to create the respective function in the. Python file. Edit the function in the Python file, to enable the file dialog (similar function as in LocalImage.py). To create the Iso Generator Button:\nWe like to copy the field of the Update-Button from the internal module IsoCSOGenerator, but not its layout so:\nCreate a new Field in the interface, called IsoGenerator, which contains the internal field Update from the module IsoCSOGenerator. Create a new Button in your Window which uses the field IsoGenerator. After these steps, you can use the Iso Generator button to create CSOs.\nIsoCSOs.script\nInterface { Inputs {} Outputs {} Parameters { Field IsoGenerator { internalName = CSOIsoGenerator.apply } } } Commands { source = $(LOCAL)/IsoCSOs.py } Window { TabView { TabViewItem Main { Vertical { Horizontal { Field LocalImage.name {} Button { title = \u0026#34;Browse...\u0026#34; command = fileDialog } Button IsoGenerator { title = \u0026#34;Iso Generator\u0026#34; } } Horizontal { Viewer View2D.self { type = SoRenderArea pw = 400 ph = 400 } Viewer SoExaminerViewer.self { type = SoExaminerViewer pw = 400 ph = 400 } } } } TabViewItem Settings { } } } IsoCSOs.py\nfrom mevis import * def fileDialog(): exp = ctx.expandFilename(ctx.field(\u0026#34;LocalImage.name\u0026#34;).stringValue()) filename = MLABFileDialog.getOpenFileName(exp, \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Open file\u0026#34;) if filename: ctx.field(\u0026#34;LocalImage.name\u0026#34;).value = ctx.unexpandFilename(filename) Automatically generate CSOs based on Iso value Colorizing CSOs We like to colorize the CSO we hover over with our mouse in the 2D viewer. Additionally, when clicking a CSO with the left mouse key , this CSO shall be colorized in the 3D viewer. This functionality can be implemented via Python scripting (even though MeVisLab has a build-in function to do that). We can do this in the following way:\nEnable the View Scripting Assistant, which translates actions into Python code.\nScripting Assistant Enable a functionality which allows us to notice the id of the CSO we are currently hovering over with our mouse. For this open the internal network of our macro module. We will use the module SoView2DCSOExtensibleEditor. Open its panel and select the tab Advanced. You can check a box to enable Update CSO id under mouse. If you now hover over a CSO, you can see its id in the panel. We can save the internal network to save this functionality, but we can also solve our problem via scripting. The Scripting Assistant translated our action into code, which we can use.\nEnabling CSO id identification We like to activate this functionality when opening the panel of our macro module IsoCSOs. Thus, we add a starting command to the control Window. We can call this command for example enableFunctionalities.\nIn the .script file:\nIsoCSOs.script\nWindow { windowActivatedCommand = enableFunctionalities TabView { TabViewItem Main { ... } } } In the Python file, we define the function enableFunctionalities. We see our action as Python code in the Scripting Assistant. Just copy the code into our Python function.\nIsoCSOs.py\ndef enableFunctionalities(): ctx.field(\u0026#34;SoView2DCSOExtensibleEditor.updateCSOIdUnderMouseCursor\u0026#34;).value = True Implement a field listener. This field listener will detect when you hover over a CSO and the CSO id changes. Triggered by a CSO id change, a colorization function will be executed and colorize the selected CSO. In the .script file:\nIsoCSOs.script\nCommands { source = $(LOCAL)/IsoCSOs.py FieldListener SoView2DCSOExtensibleEditor.csoIdUnderMouseCursor { command = colorizeCSO } } In the Python file:\nIsoCSOs.py\n# global variables listCSOs = [] idxCSO = -1 def colorizeCSO(): if ctx.field(\u0026#34;CSOManager.numCSOs\u0026#34;) == 0: pass else: global listCSOs global idxCSO if listCSOs == []: listCSOs = ctx.field(\u0026#34;CSOManager.outCSOList\u0026#34;).object() # COLORIZATION OF CSO # Changing back color of previously selected CSO to default value if idxCSO \u0026gt;= 0: oldCSO = listCSOs.getCSOAt(idxCSO) oldCSO.setPathPointColor((1.0, 1.0, 0.0)) # Color change of CSO oldCSO.setPathPointWidth(1) # Line width change # Changing color and width of selected CSO idxCSO = ctx.field(\u0026#34;SoView2DCSOExtensibleEditor.csoIdUnderMouseCursor\u0026#34;).value - 1 # -1 because CSOs are indexed starting at 1 if idxCSO \u0026gt;= 0: currentCSO = listCSOs.getCSOAt(idxCSO) currentCSO.setPathPointColor((1.0, 0.0, 1.0)) currentCSO.setPathPointWidth(5) Reload your module ( F5 ) and open the panel. After generating CSOs, the CSO under your mouse is marked. Clicking this CSO enables the marking in the 3D viewer. If you like, you can add some settings to your Settings page. For example\nIsoCSOs.script\nTabViewItem Settings { Field CSOIsoGenerator.isoValue {} Field SoCSOVisualizationSettings.ghostingDepthInVoxel {} } Colored selection Summary The control Tabview creates tabs in panels. The control Viewer allows to add viewers to your panel. The control Button creates a button executing a Python function when pressed. The tag WindowActivationCommand of the control Window triggers Python functions executed when opening the panel. Field listeners can be used to activate Python functions triggered by a change of defined parameter fields.

You will learn how to implement field listeners and react on events.\nSteps to do Create your network Start with an empty network and add the Module ImageLoad to your workspace. Then add a View2D and View3D to your workspace and connect the modules as seen below.\nLoading and viewing images Load an image Now double-click on the ImageLoad module and open any image.

Click Next \u0026gt;.\nMacro Module Properties You can leave all fields empty for now and just click Create.\nModule Field Interface MeVisLab reloads its internal database and you can open a new Tab. Search for your newly created module, in our case it was MyViewerApplication.\nMyViewerApplication In case you double click your module now, you will see the Automatic Panel only showing the name of your module, because we did not add any own Window until now.\nDevelop your User Interface Before adding your own UI, open internal network of your Macro Module via right-click and [ Show Internal Network ]. Open the panel of your ImageLoad module and set filename to an empty string (clear). This is necessary for later.\nNow, right-click on your MyViewerApplication and select [ Related Files \u0026rarr; MyViewerApplication.script ]\nMATE opens showing your script file. You already learned how to create simple UI elements in Example 2.4. Now we will create a little more complex UI including your View2D and View3D.\nFirst we need a new Field in your Parameters section. Name the field filepath and set internalName to ImageLoad.filename.\nMyViewerApplication.script\nInterface { Inputs {} Outputs {} Parameters { Field filepath { internalName = ImageLoad.filename } } } We now re-use the filepath field from the ImageLoad module for our interface. Add a Window and a Vertical to the bottom of your .script file. Add the just created parameter field filepath inside your Vertical as seen below.\nMyViewerApplication.script\nInterface { Inputs {} Outputs {} Parameters { Field filepath { internalName = ImageLoad.filename } } } Commands { source = $(LOCAL)/MyViewerApplication.py } Window { Vertical { Field filepath {} } } If you now double-click on your module, you can see your just created filepath field.\nFilepath field in UI Next, we will add your 2D and 3D Viewers and a Button to your Window. Change your .script file as seen below:\nMyViewerApplication.script\nWindow { Vertical { Horizontal { Field filepath {} Button { title = \u0026#34;Reset\u0026#34; } } Horizontal { Viewer View2D.self { type = SoRenderArea pw = 400 ph = 400 expandX = yes expandY = yes } Viewer View3D.self { pw = 400 ph = 400 expandX = yes expandY = yes } } } } We have a vertical Layout having 2 items placed horizontally next to each other. The new Button gets the title Reset but does nothing, yet because we did not add a Python function to a command.\nAdditionally we added the View2D and the View3D to our Window and defined the height, width and the expandX/Y property to yes. This leads our viewers to resize together with our Window.\nExtra Infos:\u0026nbsp; Additional information about the View2D and View3D options can be found in the MeVisLab MDL Reference You can now play around with your module in MeVisLab SDK. Open the Window and select a file. You can see the 2 viewers showing the 2D and 3D images. You can interact with your viewers the same way as in your MeVisLab network. All functionalities are taken from the modules and transferred to your user interface.\n2D and 3D viewers in our application Develop a python function for your Button Next we want to reset the filepath to an empty string on clicking our Reset button. Add the reset command to your Button. MyViewerApplication.script\n... Button { title = \u0026#34;Reset\u0026#34; command = reset } ... Right-click on reset and select [ Create Python function \u0026#39;reset\u0026#39; ]. MATE opens the Python file of your module and automatically adds the function definition. Set the filename of the ImageLoad module to an empty string.\nMyViewerApplication.py\nfrom mevis import * def reset(): ctx.field(\u0026#34;filepath\u0026#34;).value = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; Clicking on Reset in your module now clears the filename field and the viewers do not show any images anymore.\nField listeners A field listener watches a given field in your network and reacts on any changes of the field value. You can define Python functions to execute in case a change has been detected.\nIn order to define such a listener, you need to add it to the Commands section in your .script file.\nExample: MyViewerApplication.script\nCommands { source = $(LOCAL)/MyViewerApplication.py FieldListener View2D.startSlice { command = printCurrentSliceNumber } } In the above example, we react on changes of the field startSlice of the module View2D. Whenever the field value (currently displayed slice) changes, the Python function printCurrentSliceNumber is executed.\nIn your Python file Filter.py you can now add the following:\nFilter.py\ndef printCurrentSliceNumber(field): MLAB.log(field.value) Scrolling through slices in the View2D module now logs a message containing the slice number currently visible to the MeVisLab Debug Output.\nSummary You can add any Viewers to your application UI by reusing them in MDL. Parameter Fields using the internalName of an existing field in your network allow to re-use this UI element in your own UI. Changes in your UI are applied to the field in the module. Field Listeners allow you to react on changes of a field value in Python. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Download .mlab file here.

With the help of these modules, Open Inventor scenes can be implemented.\nThis chapter will start with an example Open Inventor scene. Explanations to Open Inventor scenes will follow the example.\nOpen Inventor Scenes and Execution of Scene Graphs Inventor scenes are organized in structures called scene graphs. A scene graph is made up of nodes, which represent 3D objects to be drawn, properties of the 3D objects, nodes that combine other nodes and are used for hierarchical grouping, and others (cameras, lights, etc.). These nodes are accordingly called shape nodes, property nodes, group nodes and so on. Each node contains one or more pieces of information stored in fields. For example, the Sphere node contains only its radius, stored in its radius field. Open Inventor modules function as Inventor nodes, so they may have input connectors to add Inventor child nodes (modules) and output connectors to link themselves to Inventor parent nodes (modules).\nOpen Inventor Scenes:\u0026nbsp; The following shows the order in which the modules are executed. The red arrow shows the order of traversal, from top to bottom and left to right. The numbers designate the order in which each module is passed first, from 1 to 8.

Custom CSOs are displayed in white and interpolated CSOs are marked in yellow.\nInterpolated CSOs Group CSOs We like to segment both lobes of the lung. To distinguish the CSOs of both lungs, we like to group CSOs together, according to the lung, they belong to. First, we like to group together all CSOs belonging to the lung we already segmented. In order to do this, open the CSOManager. Create a new Group and label that Group. We chose the label Left Lung. Now, mark the created Group and all CSOs you want to include into that group and press Combine.

We labeled this Group Right Lung. Again, mark the group and the CSOs you like to combine and press Combine. Grouping remaining CSOs To visually distinguish the CSOs of both groups, change the color of each group under [ Group \u0026rarr; Visuals ].

The pink circles you can see are called Seed Points.\nSeed Points define the shape of the CSO. In case of a rectangle, you need four Seed Points forming the corners, to define the whole rectangle.\nThe points forming the blue lines are called Path Points.\nThe Path Points form the connection between the Seed Points whereby contour objects (CSOs) are generated. CSOs are often closed, but do not need to be.\nIn general, the Seed Points are created interactively using an editor module and the Path Points are generated automatically by interpolation or other algorithms.\nContour Segmented Object (CSO) CSO Editors As mentioned, when creating CSOs, you can do this interactively by using an editor.\nThe following images show editors available in MeVisLab for drawing CSOs:\nSoCSOPointEditor SoCSOAngleEditor SoCSOArrowEditor SoCSODistanceLineEditor SoCSODistancePolylineEditor SoCSOEllipseEditor SoCSORectangleEditor SoCSOSplineEditor SoCSOPolygonEditor SoCSOIsoEditor SoCSOLiveWireEditor Extra Infos:\u0026nbsp; The SoCSOIsoEditor and SoCSOLiveWireEditor are special, because they are using an algorithm to detect edges themselves.\nThe SoCSOIsoEditor generates iso-contours interactively. The SoCSOLiveWireEditor renders and semi-interactively generated CSOs based on the LiveWire algorithm. CSO Lists and CSO Groups All created CSOs are stored in CSO lists, which can be saved and loaded on demand. The lists can not only store the coordinates of the CSOs but also additional information in form of name-value pares (using specialized modules or python scripting).\nBasic CSO Network Each SoCSO*Editor requires a SoView2DCSOExtensibleEditor which manages attached CSO editors and renderers and offers an optional default renderer for all types of CSOs. In addition to that, the list of CSOs needs to be stored in a CSOManager.\nThe appearance of the CSO can be defined by using a SoCSOVisualizationSettings module.\nCSOs can also be grouped together. The following image shows two different CSO groups. Groups can be used to organize CSOs, in this case to distinguish the CSOs of the right and the left lung. Here you can find more information about CSO Groups.\nCSO Groups Examples There is a bunch of modules which enables not only the creation, but also the manipulation, analysis and grouping of CSOs.

The module SoCone creates a cone shaped object, which can be displayed in the Viewer SoExaminerViewer.\nSoExaminerViewer We like to change the color of the cone. In order to do so, add the module SoMaterial to the workspace and connect the module as shown below. When creating Open Inventor scene (by creating networks of Open Inventor modules), the sequence of module connections, in this case the sequence of the inputs to the module SoExaminerViewer determines the functionality of the network.\nOpen Inventor modules are executed like scene graphs. This means, modules are executed from top to bottom and from left to right. Here, it is important to connect the module SoMaterial to an input on the left side of connection between SoCone and SoExaminerViewer. With this, we first select features like a color and these features are then assigned to all objects, which were executed afterwards. Now, open the panel of the module SoMaterial and select any Diffuse Color you like. Here, we choose green.\nColors and Material in Open Inventor We like to add a second object to the scene.\nIn order to do that, add the module SoSphere to the workspace. Connect this module to SoExaminerViewer. When connecting SoSphere to an input on the right side of the connection between the viewer and the module SoMaterial, the sphere is also colored in green. One problem now is, that currently both objects are displayed at the same position.\nAdding a SoSphere The display both objects at different positions, add the modules SoSeparator and SoTransform to the scene and connect both modules shown on the following picture. Open the panel of SoTransform and implement a translation in x-direction to shift the object. Now you can examine two things:\nThe sphere loses its green color The cone is shifted to the side Transformation The module SoTransform is responsible for shifting objects, in this case the cone, to the side. The module SoSeparator ensures that only the cone is shifted and also only the cone is colored in green. It separates this features from the rest of the scene.\nWe like to add a third object, a cube, and shift it to the other side of the sphere. Add the modules SoCube and SoTransform to the workspace and connect both modules as shown below. To shift the cube to the other side of the sphere, open the panel of SoTransform and adjust the Translation in x direction. The sphere is not affected by the translation, as the connection from SoTransform1 to SoExaminerViewer is established on the right side of the connection between SoSphere and SoExaminerViewer.\nAdding a SoCube Again, we use the module SoMaterial to select a color for the cone and the sphere.\nMultiple Materials For easier handling we group an object together with its features by using the module SoGroup. This does not separate features, which is the reason for the cube to be colorized. All modules that are derived from SoGroup offer a basically infinite number of input connectors (a new connector is added for every new connection).\nSoGroup If we do not want to colorize the cube, we have to exchange the module SoGroup by another SoSeparator module.\nSoSeparator The implementation of all objects can be grouped together.\nGrouping In addition to the objects, a background can be added to the scene using the module SoGBackground.\nSoBackground Summary Scene objects are represented by nodes. Size and position is defined by transformation nodes. A rendering node represents the root of the scene graph. Nodes are rendered in the order of traversal. Nodes on the same level are traversed from left to right.

In the OthoView2D, the rectangle is displayed in every viewing direction.\nSoView2DRectangle Using a rectangle to build a magnifier We like to use the module SoView2DRectangle to create a magnifier. In order to do that add the following modules to your workspace and connect them as shown below. We need to connect the module SoView2DRectangle to a hidden input connector of the module SynchroView2D. To be able to do this, click on your workspace and afterwards press SPACE . You can see, that SynchroView2D possesses Open Inventor input connectors. You can connect your module SoView2DRectangle to one of these connectors.\nHidden Inputs of SynchroView2D Connect Hidden Inputs of SynchroView2D In addition to that, add two types of the module DecomposeVector3 to your network. In MeVisLab exist different data types, for example vectors, or single variable, which contain the data type float or integer. This module can be used to convert field values of type vector (in this case a vector consisting of three entries) into three single coordinates. You will see in the next step, why this module can be useful.\nDecomposeVector3 We like to use the module SubImage to select a section of a slice, which is than displayed in the Viewer. The idea is to display a magnified section of one slice next to the whole slice in the module SynchroView2D. In order to do that, we need to tell the module SubImage which section to display in the Viewer. The section is selected using the module SoView2DRectangle. As a last step, we need to transmit the coordinates of the chosen rectangle to the module SubImage. To do that, we will build some parameter connections.\nSubImage Now, open the panels of the modules SoView2DRectangle and DecomposeVector3 and DecomposeVector31.\nWe here rename the DecomposeVector3 modules (press F2 to do that), for a better overview.\nIn the panel of the module Rectangle in the box Position you can see the position of the rectangle given in two 3D vectors.\nWe like to use the modules DecomposeVector3 to extract the single x, y and z values of the vector. For that, create a parameter connection from the field Start Wold Pos to the vector of the module we named StartWorldPos_Rectangle and create a connection from the field End World Pos to the vector of module EndWorldPos_Rectangle. The decomposed coordinates can be now used for further parameter connections.\nParameter Connections Open the panel of the module SubImage.

Similarly, connect the parameter fields fields X, Y, Z of the module EndWorldPos_Rectangle to the field End X, End Y, End Z in the panel of the module SubImage.\nAnother Parameter Connection With this, you finished your magnifier. Open the Viewer and draw a rectangle on one slice, to see the result.\nFinal Magnifier with SubImage Exercises Invert the image inside your magnified SubImage without changing the original image.\nSummary The module OrthoView2D provides coronal, axial and sagittal views of an image. The SubImage module allows to define a region of an input image to be treated as a separate image.

It includes a Software Development Kit (SDK) and an ApplicationBuilder for deploying your applications to end-customers.\nThe MeVisLab SDK consists of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for visual programming and the advanced text editor MATE for Python scripting including code completion, debugging, profiling and automated test development or execution.\nYou can re-use thousands of pre defined Modules for image processing (2D up to 6D images) and visualization. You will get a quick introduction into the available modules and example networks in the following tutorials.\nMore than 20 years of experience and development made MeVisLab one of the most powerful development platforms for medical image processing. Several prototypes and applications have been realized on the basis of MeVisLab, including software assistants for neuro-imaging, dynamic image analysis, surgery planning, and cardiovascular analysis.\nHow to read this tutorial: This tutorial is a hands-on training. You will learn basic mechanics and features of MeVisLab. We will start by explaining the user interface and end building our own web-applications. While reading the tutorial, open the MeVisLab SDK and try to implement each step yourself. You will learn new mechanics and possibilities in MeVisLab step-by-step. Additional information and links are provided in colored boxes.\nGlossary Term Description MeVisLab MeVisLab consists of the MeVisLab SDK and the MeVisLab ApplicationBuilder. MeVisLab SDK The MeVisLab Software Development Kit (SDK) is the MeVisLab IDE including the text editor MATE and any tools integrated for debugging, testing and profiling. MeVisLab ApplicationBuilder The MeVisLab ApplicationBuilder allows you to generate installable executables from your developed networks and applications. These executables can be delivered to customers. MeVisLab IDE The MeVisLab Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is your starting point whenever you are working with MeVisLab. It provides a programming interface and an advanced text editor. MeVisLab MATE The Advanced Text Editor (MATE) is an integrated text editor for Python and MDL development in MeVisLab. It provides auto completion and syntax highlighting as well as debugging functionalities. MDL The MeVisLab Definition Language (MDL) is the language for developing basic User Interfaces for Networks and Modules in MeVisLab. Module A Module is a single instance providing encapsulated functionalities for a specific purpose. MeVisLab provides thousands of such pre-defined Modules and you can develop your own Modules for extending functionalities. Modules provide inputs and outputs for connections in a Network and/or one or more Panels for interacting. Panel A Panel is a User Interface providing possibilities to interact with MeVisLab. Field Parameters of Modules are called fields. Several different types of fields are available such as numbers, text, trigger buttons, etc. Publicly accessible fields can be modified in the Module Inspector or Panel of the selected Module. Macro Module Macro Modules encapsulate Networks including input and output into a single Module. In order to see whats inside a Macro Module, you can open the Context Menu via Right-Click and select [ Show Internal Network ]. You can chose to create Local Macros and Global Macros. Local Macro Local Macros are only available in your currently opened Network. You cannot use the Module Search in MeVisLab to find Local Macros. Global Macro Global Macros are integrated into MeVisLab and can be used in any future Networks. They are available in Module search. Network A Network defines at least two connected Modules. Example Network Each Module provides an Example Network to see how it can be used. Right-Click on the Module and select Help \u0026gt; Show Example Network Output Inspector The Output Inspector is a quick preview of the output of a specific Module. The output can be an image or any other user defined output format. For images, a 2D and 3D view including basic interactions is already available. Module Inspector The Module Inspector shows publicly available properties of the selected module and their current values. Changes in Module Inspector are applied on the fly. Workspace The Workspace is the area where you can add and connect Modules. Multiple Networks are organized in separate Tabs. Views Area The right side of the MeVisLab IDE provides a space to add several predefined panels like Output- and Module inspectors. Debug Output The Debug Output shows debugging messages of your Modules and the MeVisLab IDE. Open Inventor Open Inventor Modules process and render 3D scene objects and enable image interactions. Scene Objects CSO Contour Segmentation Objects (CSOs) WEM Winged Edge Meshes (WEMs) GVR Giga Voxel Renderer (GVR) Lookup Table (LUT) Package MeVisLab IDE User Interface First, start MeVisLab IDE. After the Welcome Screen, the standard user interface opens.\nMeVisLab IDE User Interface Workspace By default, MeVisLab starts with an empty workspace. The workspace is the place for developing and editing Networks via visual programming. Networks of Modules form the basis for all processing and visualization pipelines.\nViews Area The standard Views Area contains the Output Inspector and the Module Inspector. With the help of the Output Inspector, you can visualize the Module output.\nFurther information of each module, like information about Module parameters can be found using the Module Inspector .\nDebug Output In the Debug Output, you can find any debugging information about your MeVisLab installation.\nThe MeVisLab IDE and the layout is completely configurable. You can rearrange the items and add new views via [ Main Menu \u0026rarr; View \u0026rarr; Views ].\nFiletypes in MeVisLab Here a list of the most important file types: Extension Description .mlab Network file, includes all information about the network's modules, their settings, their connections, and module groups. Networks developed by using the MeVisLab SDK are stored as .mlab file and can only be opened having a valid SDK license. .def Module definition file, necessary for a module to be added to the common MeVisLab module database. May also include all MDL script parts (if they are not sourced out to the .script file). .script MDL script file, typically includes the user interface definition for panels. See Chapter GUI Development for an example on GUI programming. .mlimage MeVisLab internal image format for 6D images saved with all DICOM tags, lossless compression, and in all data types. .mhelp File with descriptions of all fields and the use of a module, edit- and creatable by using MATE. See Help files for details. .py Python file, used for scripting in macro modules. See Python scripting for an example on macro programming. .dcm DCM part of the imported DICOM file, see Importing DICOM Data. Types of Modules Within the concept of MeVisLab the basic entities we are working with a graphical representations of modules having their specific functions for image processing, image visualization, and image interaction.\nThe three basic module types (ML, Open Inventor and Macro Module) are distinguished by their colors:\nType Look Characteristics ML Module (blue) ML Module Page-based, demand-driven processing of voxels Open Inventor Module (green) Open Inventor Module Visual scene graphs (3D); naming convention: all modules starting with So (for scene object) Macro Module (brown) Macro Module Combination of other module types, allowing implementing hierarchies and scripted interaction If a module is invalid, it is displayed in bright red. This might happen if the module itself is not available on your system.\nAppearance Explanation Invalid Module Invalid module Macro State Invalid Macro containing an invalid module The number of warning and error messages that are being printed to the debug console are listed at the upper right corner of the module. Once the debug console is cleared, the warning and error indicators at the module are also cleared. If the module produces information messages, their number is printed in gray at this position. This enables a network or module developer to find the modules in a network that produce messages quickly.\nModule Connectors Most modules have connectors which are displayed on the module. These represent the inputs (bottom) and outputs (top) of modules.\nIn MeVisLab, three types of connectors are defined.\nLook Appearance Definition Triangle - ML Image triangle ML images Circle - Inventor Scene half-circle Inventor scene Square - Base Object square Base objects: pointers to data structures By connecting these connectors and therefore establishing a so-called data connection, image data, or Open Inventor information is transported from one module to one or more others.\nBesides connecting connectors, basically any field of modules can be connected to other compatible fields of modules with a parameter connection.\nSome modules contain hidden connectors in addition to the ones you can see when adding a module to the workspace. Click on the workspace and press SPACE to see the hidden connectors as well as the internal networks of each module. You can now use the hidden connectors for building connections.\nExtra Infos:\u0026nbsp; For more information about connector and connection types click here\nFor more information about connecting, disconnecting, moving, and replacing connections click here\nMacro Modules More Information:\u0026nbsp; More information about creating Macro Modules is available in Tutorial Chapter I - Example 2.2 Searching and Adding Modules There are several ways to add a module to the current network, for example:\nvia the menu bar, entry [ Modules ]. via the menu bar, [ Quick Search ]. via the View Module Search. via the View Module Browser. via copy and paste from another network. by scripting, see the Scripting Reference Both the [ Modules ] menu and the Module Browser display all available modules. The modules are sorted hierarchically by topics and by module name, as given in the file Genre.def.\nTherefore, both places are a good starting point when in need of a specific function, like an image load module.\nModules Menu and Module Browser The advantage of the Module Browser is that you can right-click the entries, open the context menu and, for example, open the help (in your default Internet browser) or the module files (in MATE, the in-built text editor).\nNote:\u0026nbsp; For a module to get listed, it has to be available in the SDK distribution or in your user-defined packages. If in doubt or missing something, check out the loaded packages in the Preferences.\nFor details on packages, see Package Creation.\nUsually the quickest way to add modules to a network is the quick search in the menu bar. It offers you the possibility to search for modules by module name. By default, the search will also be extended to keywords and substrings and is case-insensitive. To change these settings, click the magnifier button for the search options.\nTip:\u0026nbsp; The quick search field does not need to have the focus. Any time you enter something in the MeVisLab GUI while not being in a dialog window, this will be entered into the quick search automatically. Quick Search Options To search for a module to load an image, you could either type load or image. Let us go with the second option this time. While typing image, the possible results appear. Use the \u0026uarr; ArrowUp or \u0026darr; ArrowDown keys on your keyboard to move to one of the listed modules. The module\u0026rsquo;s About information will appear next to it, allowing you to decide if this is the right module for you.\nQuick Search Results Tip:\u0026nbsp; For a more complex search, use the Module Search View.

Add this module to your network as shown. You can see the difference of the smoothed and the unsmoothed WEM in your viewer. There are more modules, which can modify WEMs, for example WEMExtrude. You can find them via search or in [ Modules \u0026rarr; Visualization \u0026rarr; Surface Meshes (WEM) ].\nWEMSmooth Calculate distance between WEMs Now, we like to calculate the distance between our two WEMs. In order to do this, add and connect the module WEMSurfaceDistance as shown.\nCalculate surface distance Annotations in 3D As a last step, we like to draw the calculated distances as annotations into the image. This is a little bit tricky as we need the module SoView2DAnnotation to create annotations in a 3D viewer. Add and connect the following modules as shown. What is done here? We use the module SoView2D to display a 2D image in the SoExaminerViewer, in addition to the WEMs we already see in the viewer. We do not see an additional image in the viewer, as we chose no proper input image to the module SoView2D using the module ConstantImage with value 0. Thus, we pretend having a 2D image, which we can annotate. Now, we use the module SoView2DAnnotation to annotate the pretended-2D-image, displayed in the viewer of SoExaminerViewer. We already used the module SoView2DAnnotation in Contour Example 4.\nAnnotation modules Now, change the Annotation Mode to User, as we like to insert custom annotations. In addition, disable to Show vertical ruler.\nSelect annotation mode Next, open the tab Input and draw parameter connections from the results of the distance calculations, which can be found in the panel of WEMSufaceDistance, to the input fields in the panel of SoView2DAnnotation.\nDefine annotation parameters You can design the annotation overlay as you like in the tab User. We decided to only display the minimum and maximum distance between both WEMs.\nAnnotation design As we use a 2D annotation module to annotate a 3D viewer, it is important to get rid of all 2D orientation annotations, which you can edit in the tab Orientation.\nDisable 2D orientation annotations Now, you can see the result in the viewer. If the annotations are not visible, press a a few times to change the annotation mode. Display surface distance in viewer Summary There are several modules to modify and process WEMs, eg. WEMModify, WEMSmooth. To calculate the minimal and maximal surface distance between two WEMs, use the module WEMSurfaceDistance. To create annotations in 3D, the module SoView2DAnnotation can be used, when adapted to be used in combination with a 3D-viewer. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Download .mlab file here.

Now, you are able to click on the presented Octaspehere and move it alongside one axis. The following modules are involved in the interactions:\nSoMITranslate1Dragger: This module allows interactive translation of the object alongside one axis. You can select the axis for translation in the panel of the module. SoMIDraggerContainer: This module is responsible for actually changing the translation values of the object. Interactive dragging of objects Interactively translating a WEM alongside three axis We like to be able to interactively move a WEM alongside all three axis. In MeVisLab exists the module SoMITranslate2Dragger which allows translations alongside two axis, but there is no module which allows object translation in all three directions. Therefore, we will create a network, which solves this task. The next steps will show you, how you create three planes intersecting the objects. Dragging one plane, will drag the object alongside one axis. In addition, these planes will only be visible when hovering over them.\nCreation of planes intersecting an object We start creating a plane, which will allow dragging in x direction. In order to do that, modify your network as shown: Add the modules WEMModify, and SoBackground and connect the module SoCube to the dragger modules. You can select the translation direction in the panel of SoMITranslate1Dragger.\nInteractive dragging of objects We will modify the cube to be able to use it as a dragger plane. In order to do this, open the panel of SoCube and reduce the Width to be 0. This sets a plane in Y and Z direction.\nInteractive dragging of objects We like to move the object, when dragging the plane. Thus, we need to modify the translation of our object, when moving the plane. Open the panels of the modules WEMModify and SoMIDraggerContainer and draw a parameter connection from one Translation vector to the other.\nInteractive dragging of objects As a next step, we like to adapt the size of the plane, to the size of the object we have. Add the modules WEMInfo and DecomposeVector3 to your workspace and open their panels. The module WEMInfo presents information about the given WEM, for example its position and size. The module DecomposeVector3 splits a 3D vector into its components. Now, draw a parameter connection from Size of WEMInfo to the vector in DecomposeVector3. As a next step, open the panel of SoCube and draw parameter connections from the fields Y and Z of DecomposeVector3 to Height and Depth of SoCube. Now, the size of the plane adapts to the size of the object.\nInteractive dragging of objects The result can be seen in the next image. You can now select the plane in the Interaction Mode of the module SoExaminerViewer and move the plane together with the object alongside the x-axis.\nInteractive dragging of objects Modifying the appearance of the plane For changing the visualization of the dragger plane add the modules SoGroup, SoSwitch and SoMaterial to your network and connect them as shown. In addition, group together all the modules, which are responsible for the translation in X direction.\nInteractive dragging of objects We like to switch the visualization of the plane, in dependence of the mouse position in the viewer. In other words, when hovering over the plane, the plane should be visible, when the mouse is in another position and the possibility to drag the object is not given, the plane should be invisible. We use the module SoMaterial to edit the appearance of the plane. Open the panel of the module SoMITranslate1Dragger. The box of the field Highlighted is ticked, when the mouse hovers over the plane. Thus, we can use the field\u0026rsquo;s status to switch between different presentations of the plane. In order to do this, open the panel of SoSwitch and draw a parameter connection from Highlighted of SoMITranslate1Dragger to Which Child of SoSwitch.\nInteractive dragging of objects Open the panels of the modules SoMaterial. Change the Transparency of the first SoMaterial module to make the plane invisible, when not hovering over the plane. Furthermore, changed the Diffuse Color of the module SoMaterial1 to red, so that the plane appears in red, when hovering over it.\nInteractive dragging of objects When hovering over the plane, the plane becomes visible and the option to move the object alongside the x-axis is given. When you do not hover over the plane, the plane is invisible.\nInteractive dragging of objects Interactive object translation in three dimensions We do not only want to move the object in one direction, we like to be able to do interactive object translations in all three dimensions. For this, copy the modules responsible for the translation in one direction and change the properties to enable translations in other directions.\nWe need to change the size of SoCube1 and SoCube2 to form planes, which cover surfaces in X and Z as well as X and Y directions. To do that, draw the respective parameter connections from DecomposeVector3 to the fields of the modules SoCube. In addition, we need to adapt the field Direction in the panels of the modules SoMITranslate1Dragger.\nInteractive dragging of objects As a next step, we like to make sure, that all planes always intersect the object, even though the object is moved. To to this, we need to synchronize the field Translation of all SoMIDraggerContainer modules and the module WEMModify. Draw parameter connections from one Translation field to the next, as shown below.\nInteractive dragging of objects We like to close the loop, so that a change in one field Translation causes a change in all the other Translation fields. To do this, we need to include the module SyncVector. The module SyncVector avoids an infinite processing loop causing a permanent update of all fields Translation.\nAdd the module SyncVector to your workspace and open its panel. Draw a parameter connection from the field Translation of the module SoMIDraggerContainer2 to Vector1 of SyncVector. The field Vector1 is automatically synchronized to the field Vector2. Now, connect the field Vector2 to the field Translate of the module WEMModify. Your synchronization network is now established.\nInteractive dragging of objects To enable transformations in all directions, we need to connect the modules SoMIDraggerContainer to the viewer. First, connect the modules to SoGroup, after that connect SoGroup to SoExaminerViewr.\nInteractive dragging of objects As a next step, we like to enlarge the planes, to make them exceed the object. For that, add the module CalculateVectorFromVectors to your network. Open its panel and connect the field Size of WMEInfo to Vector 1. We like to enlarge the size by one, so we add up the vector (1,1,1), by editing the field Vector 2. Now, connect the Result to the field V of the module DecomposeVector3.\nInteractive dragging of objects At last, we can condense all the modules enabling the transformation into one local macro module. For that, group all the modules together and convert the group into a macro module as shown in Chapter I: Basic Mechanisms.\nInteractive dragging of objects The result can be seen in the next image. This module can now be used for interactive 3D transformations for all kind of WEMs.\nInteractive dragging of objects Summary It exist a family of SoDragger modules, which can be used to interactively modify Open Inventor objects. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Download .mlab file here.

These information are stored in so called Primitive Value Lists (PVLs). Every node, every surface and every edge can contains such a list. In these lists, you can for example store the color of the node or specific patient information. These information can be used for visualization or for further statistical analysis.\nIn this example, we like to use PVLs to color-code and visualize the distance between two WEMs.\nSteps to do Develop your network We start our network by initializing two WEMs using WEMInitialize. We chose an Octasphere and a resized Cube. Use the modules SoWEMRenderer, SoExaminerViewer and SoBackground to visualize the WEMs.\nWEMInitialize Subdividing WEM edges As a next step, add and connect two modules WEMSubdivide, to further divide edges and surfaces. With this step we increase the node density to have an accurate distance measurement.\nWEMSubdivide The difference when selecting different maximum edge lengths can be seen in the following images.\nEdgeLength1 EdgeLength01 Distances between WEMs are stored in PVLs Now, add the modules WEMSurfaceDistance and WEMInfo to your workspace and connect them as shown. WEMSurfaceDistance calculates the minimum distance between the nodes of both WEM. The distances are stored in the nodes\u0026rsquo; PVLs as LUT values.\nDistances between surfaces Open the panels of the modules WEMSurfaceDistance and WEMInfo. In the panel of WEMInfo select the tab Statistics. You can see, the statistics of the stored PVLs. The Minimum Value and the Maximum Value are similar to the calculated Min Dist. and Max. Dist. of WEMSurfaceDistance.\nWEM information Color-coding the distance between WEMs What can we do with these information? We can use the calculated distances, stored in LUT values, to color-code the distance between the WEMs. For this, add and connect the module SoLUTEditor. Each LUT value from the PVLs will in the next step be translated into a color. But first, open the panel of SoWEMRenderer to select the Color Mode LUT Values. Now, the module SoLUTEditor defines the coloring of the WEM.\nSoWEMRenderer To translate the LUT values from the PVLs into color, open the panel of SoLUTEditor and select the tab Range. We need to define the value range, we like to work with. As the distance and thus the PVL-value is expected to be 0 when the surfaces of both WEMs meet, we set the New Range Min to 0. As the size of the WEMs does not exceed 3, we set the New Range Max to 3. After that, press Apply new Range.\nSoLUTEditor Our goal is to colorize faces of the Octasphere in red, if they are close to or even intersect the cubic WEM. And we like to colorize faces of the Octasphere in green, if these faces are far away from the cubic WEM.\nOpen the tab Editor of the panel of SoLUTEditor. This tab allows to interactively select a color for each PVL-value. Select the color point on the left side. Its Position value is supposed to be 0, so we like to select the Color red in order to color-code small distances between the WEMs in red. In addition to that, increase the Opacity of this color point. Next, select the right color point. Its Position is supposed to be 3 and thus equals value of the field New Range Max. As these color point colorize large distances between WEMs, select the Color green. You can add new color points by clicking on the colorized bar in the panel. Select for example the Color yellow for a color point in the middle. Select and shift the color points to get the desired visualization.\nChanging the LUT Add the module WEMModify to your workspace and connect the module as shown. If you now shift the WEM using WEMModify, you can see that the colorization adapts.\nWEMModify Interactive shift of WEMs As a next step, we like to implement the interactive shift of the WEM. Add the modules SoTranlateDragger1 and SyncVector. Connect all translation vectors: Draw connections from the field Translate of SoTranslateDragger1 to Vector1 of SyncVector, from Vector2 of SyncVector to Translate of WEMModify, and at last from Translate of WEMModify to Translate of SoTranslateDragger1.\nYou can now interactively drag the WEM insight the viewer.\nDragging the WEM At last, exchange the module WEMInitialize with WEMLoad and load venus.off. You can decrease the Face Alpha in the panel of SoWEMRenderer1 to make that WEM transparent.\nWEM transparency The result can be seen in the next image.\nYour final result Summary Additional information of WEMs can be stored in Primitive Value Lists (PVL), attached to nodes, edges or faces. The module WEMSurfaceDistance stores the minimum distance between nodes of different WEMs in PVLs, as LUT values. PVLs containing LUT values can be used to color-code additional information on the WEM surface. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Download .mlab file here.

If you like to know which WEM formats can be imported into MeVisLab, take a look at the assimp documentation here.\nWEM explained with MeVisLab To explain WEMs in MeVisLab we will build a network, which shows the structure and the characteristics of WEMs. We will start the example by generating a WEM forming a cube. With this, we will explain structures of WEMs called Edges, Nodes, Surfaces, and Normals.\nInitialize a WEM Add the module WEMInitialize to your workspace, open its panel and select a Cube. In general, a WEM is made up of surfaces. Here all surfaces are squares. In MeVisLab it is common to build WEMs out of triangles.\nWEM initializing Rendering of WEMs For rendering WEMs, you can use the module SoWEMRenderer in combination with the viewer SoExaminerViewer. Add both modules to your network and connect them as shown. A background is always a nice feature to have. WEM rendering Geometry of WEMs The geometry of WEMs is given by different structures. Using specialized WEM-Renderer modules, all structures can be visualized.\nEdges Add and connect the module SoWEMRendererEdges to your workspace to enable the rendering of WEM Edges. Here, we manipulated the line thickness, to make the lines of the edges thicker. WEM Edges Nodes Nodes mark the corner points of each surface. Therefore, nodes define the geometric properties of every WEM. To visualize the nodes, add and connect the module SoWEMRendererNodes as shown. Per default, the nodes are visualized with an offset to the position they are located in. We reduced the offset to be zero, increased the point size and changed the color. WEM Nodes Faces Between the nodes and alongside the edges surfaces are created. The rendering of these surfaces can be enabled and disabled using the panel of SoWEMRenderer. WEM Faces Normals Normals display the orthogonal vector either to the faces (Face Normals) or to the nodes (Nodes Normals). With the help of the module SoWEMRendererNormals these structures can be visualized.\nWEM normal editor WEMNodeNormals WEMFaceNormals WEMs in MeVisLab In MeVisLab WEMs can consist of triangles, squares or other polygons. Most common in MeVisLab are surfaces composed of triangles, as shown in the following example. With the help of the module WEMLoad existing WEMs can be loaded into the network.\nWEMTriangles WEMNetwork WEMSurface Summary WEMs are polygon meshes, in most cases composed of triangles WEM\u0026rsquo;s geometry is determined by nodes, edges, faces and normals, which can be visualized using renderer modules Examples The following examples can give you a first impression of working with WEMs. You will learn how to\nSurface Example 1: Creation of WEMs Surface Example 2: Processing and Modification of WEM Surface Example 3: Interactions with WEM Surface Example 4: Interactively moving WEM Surface Example 5: WEM - Primitive Value Lists ","tags":["Beginner","Tutorial","Data Objects","3D","Surfaces","Meshes","WEM"],"section":"tutorials"},{"date":"1655276193","url":"https://mevislab.github.io/examples/examples/visualization/example1/","title":"Visualization Example 1: Synchronous view of two images","summary":"Visualization Example 1: Synchronous view of two images This very simple example shows how to load an image and apply a basic Convolution filter to the image.

Basic Mechanics of MeVisLab (Example: Building a Contour Filter) In this chapter you will learn the basic mechanics of the MeVisLab IDE. You will learn how to re-use existing Modules to load and view data, and you will build your first processing pipeline. Extra Infos:\u0026nbsp; Additional information about the basics of MeVisLab are explained here Loading Data First, we need to load the data we like to work on. In MeVisLab, you usually use modules to perform specific tasks. Modules are the basic entities you will be working with. Each module has a specific functionality for processing, visualization and interaction. Connecting these modules enables the development of complex processing pipelines. You will get to know different types of modules throughout the course of this tutorial.\nBy now, we will load our data by using the module ImageLoad. You can find this module via search and add it to your Workspace.\nSearch for ImageLoad As a next step, we like to select and load the data we like to process. Double-click the Module ImageLoad to open its Panel. Now, you can browse through your folders to select the data you like to open. You can find example data in the MeVisLab DemoData directory $(InstallDir)/Packages/MeVisLab/Resources/DemoData located in the MeVisLab installation path. Select a file, for example an MRI scan of a shoulder Shoulder_Fracture.tif. The image is loaded immediately and basic information of the loaded image can be seen in the Panel.\nExtra Infos:\u0026nbsp; Multiple additional Modules for loading data are available such as:\nDicomImport for loading DICOM Images LocalImage for loading any image format For details about loading DICOM images, see here\nThe Output-Inspector and the Module Inspector For a first inspection and visualization of the loaded data, we can use the Output Inspector located in the Views area. You can already interact with the image via Mouse-Wheel and Mouse Buttons / . To preview the image, click on the triangle on the top side of the module ImageLoad, which offers the module output. All module outputs can be found at the top side of the respective module.\nYou can now inspect your image in 2D.\nOutput Inspector Your image does not look like this? One reason might be that the slice of the image you are looking at has no information. Click on the Output Inspector and scroll through the slices (slicing) by using the mouse wheel . Still not seeing anything? Then try to adjust the contrast of the given image by keeping the right mouse button pressed while moving the mouse.\nYou are not restricted to only see your image in 2D. The Output Inspector offers a 3D View of the selected data. For this, click on the tab 3D of the Output Inspector. The 3D view of the image can be rotated by left-clicking on the image and moving the courser around. The little cube in the lower right corner of the viewer shows the orientation of the image.\nNotation:\u0026nbsp; A = anterior, front P = posterior, back R = right side L = left side H = head F = feet Below the Output Inspector, you can find the Module Inspector. The Module Inspector displays properties and parameters of the selected module. Parameters are stored in so called Fields. Using the Module Inspector you can examine different fields of the module ImageLoad. The module has for example the fields filename (the path, the loaded image is stored in) and sizeX, sizeY, sizeZ (the size of the loaded image).\nModule Inspector Viewer Instead of using the Output Inspector to inspect images, it is sensible to add a viewer to the network. Search for the module View2D and add it to your workspace. Most modules have different connectors. Data were transmitted via output connectors on the top side of a module and can be received by other modules via input connectors on the bottom side of the module.\nThe module View2D has one input connector for the voxel-images on the bottom side (triangle) and three other possible inputs (half-circles), which will be explained later on. In general, module outputs can be connected to module inputs with the same symbol and thus transmit information and data between modules.\n2D Viewer You can now add the loaded image to the viewer by connecting the image output of the module ImageLoad with the image input of the module View2D. This is done as follows:\nClick the output connector of ImageLoad.\nKeep the left mouse button pressed while dragging the connection to the input connector of View2D (white line).\nCheck that the connection is well-defined (green line).\nAt the input connector of View2D, release the mouse button and establish the connection (blue line).\nEstablish connection Although the connection is established, no image rendering has started yet. To initialize rendering, open the View2D panel by double-clicking the module View2D in your network. Similar to the Output Inspector, you can scroll through the slices and change the contrast. By pressing the A you can switch the annotation mode.\nView2D Panel You can also disconnect the Modules by dragging the connection away from the input or output connector of the Modules.\nConnections between compatible outputs and inputs are established automatically in case 2 Modules are moved close enough to each other.\nExtra Infos:\u0026nbsp; Connecting, Disconnecting, Moving and Replacing Connections is explained here Image Processing Next, we like to add a processing step to our network. We like to smooth the image using an average kernel. In order to do that, search for the module Convolution and add it to the workspace. Delete the established connection from the module ImageLoad to the module View2D by clicking on the connection and pressing DEL . Now, you can build new connections from the module ImageLoad to the module Convolution and from this module to View2D.\nConvolution Module Double-click the module Convolution to open its panel. The panel allows configurations of the module. You can adjust parameters or in this case select a kernel, for example the 3x3 Avarage Kernel.\nSelect a Kernel The module View2D is now displaying the smoothed image.\nTo see the difference between the processed and the unprocessed image, click on the output of the module ImageLoad to view the original image in the Output Inspector . The great thing about the Output Inspector is that it can display the output of any connector in the process chain (as long as a format is used, the inspector can interpret). Simply click the connector or connection to find out more about the module output.\nThere is another way of inspecting the difference between the processed and the unprocessed image. Add a second viewer module View2D to your workspace. The new module gets a different name: View2D1. It is possible to establish numerous connections from one module output to different other module inputs, but a module input can only receive one connection. Connect the module ImageLoad to the second viewer to display two images at the same time. You can scroll through the slices of both viewers and inspect the images.\nMultiple Viewer Parameter Connection for Synchronization In our example you can scroll through the slices of both viewers independently. To inspect the effect of the filter, it would be helpful to synchronize both viewers in a way, that both show the same slices.\nWe already know data connections between module inputs and outputs. Besides module connections, it is also possible to connect module fields via a parameter connection. The values of connected fields are synchronized, that means when changing the value of one field, all fields connected to this field will be adapted to the same value.\nIn this chapter we like to establish parameter connections to allow the synchronized use of both image viewers. In order to do that, search for the module SyncFloat and add it to your workspace.\nSyncFloat Module We like to synchronize the field startSlice of both viewers, to be able to show the same slice in both viewers simultaneously.\nFirst, right-click the viewer View2D to open its context menu and select [ Show Window \u0026rarr; Automatic Panel ].\nAutomatic Panel View2D This option shows all parameter fields of the module View2D.\nSearch for the field startSlice. The field indicates which slice is currently shown in the Viewer. If you scroll through the slices of an image the value of startSlice changes.\nNow, double-click the module SyncFloat to open its panel.\nClick on the label startSlice in the automatic panel of the module View2D, keep the button pressed and drag the connection to the label Float1 in the panel of the module SyncFloat.\nSynchronize StartSlice The connection is drawn as a thin grey arrow between both modules with the arrowhead pointing to the module that receives the field value as input. The value of the field starSlice is now transmitted to the field Float1. Changing StartSlice automatically changes Float1, but not the other way round.\nParameter Connection StartSlice We now like to establish a connection from the module SyncFloat to the second viewer, Viewer2D1. In order to do that, open the automatic panel View2D1. Draw a connection from the label Float2 of the panel of the module SyncFloat to the label startSlice in the automatic panel of the module View2D1. At last, implement a connection between the parameter fields startSlice of both viewers. Draw the connection from View2D1 to View2D.\nSynchronize both directions As a result, scrolling through the slices with the mouse wheel in one of the viewers synchronizes the rendered slice in the second viewer. In this case, you can inspect the differences between smoothed and unsmoothed data on every single slice.\nYour final Network You can also use the pre-defined Module SynchroView2D to reach the same goal (shown in this chapter ).\nGrouping Modules In this chapter we like to create a contour filter. To finalize the filter, add the modules Arithmetic2 and Morphology to your workspace and connect the modules as shown below. Double-click the module Arithmetic2 to open its panel. Change the field Function of the module Arithmetic2 to use the function subtract in the panel of the module. With this, we finished our contour filter. You can inspect each processing step using the Output Inspector by clicking on the input and output connectors of the respective modules. The final results can be inspected using the viewers. If necessary, adjust the contrast by pressing the right-key and moving the cursor.\nGrouping Modules If you like to know more information about each module, search for help. You can do this by right-clicking the module and select help, which offers an example network and further information about this module.\nModule Help To distinguish the image processing pipeline, you can create a group for it. For that: Select the three modules, for example by dragging a selection rectangle around them. Right-click the selection to open the context menu and select [ Add to New Group ].\nAdd to new Group Enter a name for the new group, for example Filter. The new group is created and displayed as a green rectangle. The group allows for quick interactions with all its modules together.\nYour Filter Group Your network gets very complex and you lost track? No problem. Let MeVisLab arrange your modules automatically via [ Mein Menu \u0026rarr; Edit \u0026rarr; Auto Arrange Selection ] (or via keyboard shortcut CTRL + 1 ).\nNow, it is time to save your first network. Open the tab [ File \u0026rarr; Save ] to save the network in an .mlab file.\nExtra Infos:\u0026nbsp; More information on module groups can be found here Macro-Modules We now like to condense our filter into one single module. You have probably already noticed, that the modules have different colors. Each color represents a special type of modules. The blue modules are called ML-Modules and are responsible for the processing of voxel-images. The brown modules are called macro modules. Macro modules encapsulate a whole network in a single module. You can right-click on one macro-module to open the context menu and select Show Internal Network to see the internal network structure. In addition, macro modules enable the implementation of custom functionalities via python scripting.\nWe now like to condense the modules forming the contour filter into one single macro module. To do that, right-click on the group-title and select Convert To Local Macro. Now, you need to select a name for your macro module and finish the creation of the module. With this you create a local macro module. Local macro modules can only be used in your current network.\nConvert to Local Macro Your first Local Macro Right-click the macro module and select Show Internal Network to inspect and change the internal network. You can change the properties of the new macro module by changing the properties in the internal network. As before, you can for example right-click the module Convolution and change the Kernel. These changes will be preserved.\nInternal Network of your Local Macro \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;This example is also available on YouTube. Extra Infos:\u0026nbsp; Module handling is explained here\nMore information about Marco Modules can be found here\nSummary MeVisLab provides pre-defined Modules you can re-use and connect for building more or less complex networks. Each Module output can be previewed by using the Output Inspector. Each Module provides Example Networks to explain their usage. Parameters of each Module can be changed in the Module Inspector or Automatic Panel of the Module. Parameter connections can be established to synchronize the values of these parameters. Modules can be grouped. Grouped Modules can be encapsulated to Macro Modules. Macro Modules encapsulate networks. Internal networks can be shown and modified. Any changes of the internal network are applied to the Macro Module. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Download .mlab file here.

The following modules are available:\nSoCSOPointEditor SoCSOAngleEditor SoCSOArrowEditor SoCSODistanceLineEditor SoCSODistancePolylineEditor SoCSOEllipseEditor SoCSORectangleEditor SoCSOIsoEditor SoCSOSplineEditor SoCSOPolygonEditor SoCSOLiveWireEditor For saving and loading existing CSOs, the modules CSOSave and CSOLoad can be used.\n3D data / meshes Winged Edge Mesh (WEM) 3-dimensional meshes in MeVisLab are handled via WEMs (Winged Edge Mesh).\nThe module WEMLoad loads different 3D mesh file formats like:\nObject File Format (*.off *.geom) Wavefront (*.obj) Polygon File Format (*.ply) Standard Tessellation Language (*.stl) VRML (*.wrl) Winged Edge Mesh (*.wem) WEMLoad Module WEMs can be rendered via Open Inventor by using the modules SoExaminerViewer or SoRenderArea and SoCameraInteraction.\nBefore visualizing a WEM, it needs to be converted to a Scene Object via SoWEMRenderer.\nSoWEMRenderer Module Extra Infos:\u0026nbsp; Tutorials for WEMs are available here. Loading arbitrary 3D files The SoSceneLoader module is able to load external 3D formats. MeVisLab uses the integrated assimp ThirdParty library which is able to import most common 3D file types. The currently integrated assimp version can be found here Extra Infos:\u0026nbsp; Supported file formats of the assimp library are documented on their website. SoSceneLoader Module The SoSceneLoader module generates a 3D scene from your loaded files which can be rendered via SoExaminerViewer or SoRenderArea and SoCameraInteraction Extra Infos:\u0026nbsp; Example usage is explained in the tutorials for Open Inventor.
