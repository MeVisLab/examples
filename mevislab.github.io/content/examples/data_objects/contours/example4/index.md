# Contour Example 4: Annotation of images
This example shows how to add annotations to an image.

## Summary
In this example, the network of **Contour Example 3** is extended so that the volume of the 3D mask generated by the `VoxelizeCSO` module is calculated. The `CalculateVolume` module counts the number of voxels in the given mask and returns the correct volume in ml. The calculated volume will be used for a custom `SoView2DAnnotation` displayed in the `View2D`.
