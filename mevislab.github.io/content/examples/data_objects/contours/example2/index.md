# Contour Example 2: Contour Interpolation
This example shows how to interpolate CSOs across slices.

## Summary
In this example, semiautomatic countours are created using the `SoCSOLiveWireEditor` module and their visualization is modified using the `SoCSOVisualizationSettings` module.

Additional contours between the manually created ones are generated by the `CSOSliceInterpolator` and added to the `CSOManager`. Different groups of contours are created for the left and right lobe of the lung and colored respectively.
