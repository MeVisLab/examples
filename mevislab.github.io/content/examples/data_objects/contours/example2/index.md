# Contour Example 2: Contour interpolation
This example shows how to interpolate CSOs over slices.

## Summary
In this example, semi-automatic countours are created by using a `SoCSOLiveWireEditor`. The created contours are managed by a `CSOManager`. Visualization of the contours is customized by using a `SoCSOVisualizationSettings` module.

In the end, additional contours between the manual contours are generated by the `CSOSliceInterpolator` and added to the `CSOManager`. Different groups of contours are created for left and right lung lobe and colored separately.
