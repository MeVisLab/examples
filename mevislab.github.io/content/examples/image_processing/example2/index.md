# Image Processing Example 2: Masking images
In this example, we create a simple mask on an image, so that background pixels are not affected by changes of the window/level values.

## Summary
We are loading images by using the `LocalImage` module and show them in a `SynchroView2D`. The same image is shown in the right viewer of the `SynchroView2D` but with a `Threshold` based `Mask`.
