# Image Processing Example 1: Arithmetic operations on two images
In this example, we apply scalar functions on two images like Add, Multiply, Subtract, etc.

## Summary
We are loading two images by using the `LocalImage` module and show them in a `SynchroView2D`. In addition to that, both images are used for arithmetic processing in the module `Arithmetic2`.
