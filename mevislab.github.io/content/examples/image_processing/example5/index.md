# Image Processing Example 5: Clip Planes
In this example, we are using the currently visible slice from a 2D view as a clip plane in 3D.

## Summary
We are loading images by using the `LocalImage` module and render them as a 2-dimensional image stack `SoRenderArea`. The displayed slice is used to create a 3D plane/clip plane in a `SoExaminerViewer`.
