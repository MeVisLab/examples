# Image Processing Example 4: Subtract 3D Objects
In this example, we subtract a sphere from another WEM.

## Summary
We are loading images by using the `LocalImage` module and render them as a 3D scene in a `SoExaminerViewer`. We also add a sphere that is then subtracted from the original surface.
