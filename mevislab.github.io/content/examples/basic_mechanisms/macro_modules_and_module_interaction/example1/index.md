# Example 1: Panel for the contour filter
This example contains a whole package structure. Inside you can find the example contour filter for which a panel was created.

## Summary
A new macro module `Filter` has been created. Initially macro modules do not provide an own panel containing user interface elements such as buttons. The *Automatic Panel* is shown on double-clicking the module providing the name of the module.

In this example we update the *\*.script* file of the `Filter` module to display the kernel selection field of the `Convolution` module within its network.

Changes applied to fields in the macro module's panel are applied to their internal network as well.
