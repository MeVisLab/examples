# Example 1: Panel for the contour filter
This example contains a whole package structure. Inside you can find the example contour filter for which a panel was created.

## Summary
A new Macro Module `Filter` has been created. Initially Macro Modules do not provide an own Panel containing user interface elements such as Buttons. The *Automatic Panel* is shown on double-clicking the module providing the name of the module.

In this example we update the \*.script* file of the module `Filter` and add the kernel selection field from the internal networks `Convolution` module to our own module UI. Changes of the kernel are automatically applied to our internal network.
