# Example 2: Python scripting
This example shows how to create module interactions via Python scripting.

## Summary
A new macro module `IsoCSOs` is created providing two viewers in its internal network, `View2D` and `SoExaminerViewer`. Both viewers are included in the panel of the module.

To showcase how Python functions can be implemented in MeVisLab and called from within a module, additional buttons to browse directories and create contours via the `CSOIsoGenerator` are added. Lastly a field listener is implemented reacting to field changes by colorizing contours when the user hovers over them with the mouse.
