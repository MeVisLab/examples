# Image Processing in MeVisLab {#TutorialImageProcessing}
Digital image processing is the use of a digital computer to process digital images through an algorithm (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_processing)).

MeVisLab provides multiple modules for image processing tasks, such as:
* Filters
* Masks
* Transformations
* Arithmetics
* Statistics

For details about Image Processing in MeVisLab, see the {{< docuLinks "/Resources/Documentation/Publish/SDK/GettingStarted/ch06.html#FOImageProcessing" "MeVisLab Documentation">}}

In this chapter, you will find some examples for different types of image processing in MeVisLab.
