# MeVisLab Tutorial Chapter V {#TutorialChapter5}

## Data Objects in MeVisLab {#TutorialDataObjects}

MeVisLab provides a lot of pre-defined data objects for usage such as [Contours](/tutorials/dataobjects/contours/contour-objects), [Surface Objects (WEMs)](/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaces/surfaceobjects) and [Markers](/tutorials/dataobjects/markers/markers).

**The following examples are available:**
* [Contours](/tutorials/dataobjects/contourobjects "Creating 2D contours")
* [Surface Objects](/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaceobjects "Creating 3D surface objects")
* [Markers](/tutorials/dataobjects/markers "Creating markers")

Differences between these types are explained in the following chapters and example networks are built to learn how to use them.
