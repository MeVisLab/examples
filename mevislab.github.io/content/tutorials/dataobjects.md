# MeVisLab Tutorial Chapter V {#TutorialChapter5}

## Data Objects in MeVisLab {#TutorialDataObjects}

MeVisLab provides a lot of pre-defined data objects for usage such as [Contours](/tutorials/dataobjects/contours/contour-objects), [Surface Objects (WEMs)](/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaces/surfaceobjects) and [Markers](/tutorials/dataobjects/markers/markers).

Differences between these types are explained in the following chapters and example networks are built to learn how to use them.

## Examples:
1. [Contours](/tutorials/dataobjects/contours/contour-objects)
2. [Surface Objects](/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaces/surfaceobjects)
3. [Markers](/tutorials/dataobjects/markers/markers)
