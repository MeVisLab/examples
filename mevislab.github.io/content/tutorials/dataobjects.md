## Data Objects in MeVisLab {#TutorialDataObjects}

MeVisLab provides pre-defined data objects, e. g.
* [Contour Segmented Objects (CSOs)](/tutorials/dataobjects/contours/contour-objects) which are three-dimensional objects encapsulating formerly defined contours within images.
* [Surface Objects (Winged Edge Meshes or WEMs)](/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaces/surfaceobjects) 
  Description
and
* [Markers](/tutorials/dataobjects/markerobjects)
  Description.

Differences, advantages and disadvantages of each above mentioned data-object type will be covered in the following specified chapters, where you will build example networks, covering some of the most common functionalities.
