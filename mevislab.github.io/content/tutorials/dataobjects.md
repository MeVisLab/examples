## Data Objects in MeVisLab {#TutorialDataObjects}

MeVisLab provides pre-defined data objects, for example:
* [Contour Segmentation Objects (CSOs)](/tutorials/dataobjects/contourobjects) <br>
three-dimensional objects encapsulating formerly defined contours within images.
* [Surface Objects (Winged Edge Meshes or WEMs)](/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaceobjects) <br>
represent the surface of geometrical figures and allow the user to manipulate them.
* [Markers](/tutorials/dataobjects/markerobjects) <br>
are used to mark specific locations or aspects of an image and allow to process those later on.
* [Curves](tutorials/dataobjects/curves) <br>
can print the results of a function as two-dimensional mathematical graphs into a diagram.

Usage, advantages, and disadvantages of each above-mentioned data object type will be covered in the following specified chapters, where you will be building example networks for some of the most common use cases.
