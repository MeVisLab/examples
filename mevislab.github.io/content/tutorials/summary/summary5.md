# Step 5: Review - Installer creation

{{< youtube "64l3igSmeWY" >}}

## Introduction
Your macro module has been tested manually and/or automatically? Then, you should create your first installable executable and deliver it to your customer(s) for final evaluation.

{{<alert class="warning" caption="Licensing">}}
This step requires a valid **MeVisLab ApplicationBuilder** license. It extends the **MeVisLab SDK** so that you can generate an installer of your developed macro module.

Free evaluation licenses of the **MeVisLab ApplicationBuilder**, time-limited to three months, can be requested at [sales(at)mevislab.de](mailto://sales@mevislab.de).
{{</alert>}}

## Steps to Do

### Install Tools Necessary for Installer Generation
The MeVisLab Project Wizard for standalone applications {{<menuitem "File" "Run Project Wizard..." "Standalone Application" >}} provides a check for all necessary tools you need to install before generating an installer.

![MeVisLab Project Wizard](images/tutorials/summary/Example5_1.png "MeVisLab Project Wizard")

Click on *Check if required tools are installed*. The following dialog opens:

![Check required tools](images/tutorials/summary/Example5_2.png "Check required tools")

You can see that [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download) and either [Dependency Walker](http://www.dependencywalker.com/) or [Dependencies](https://github.com/lucasg/Dependencies) are necessary to create an installable executable. MeVisLab provides information about the necessary version(s).

Download and install/extract *NSIS* and *Dependency Walker* or *Dependencies*. Add both executables to your *PATH* environment variable, for example, *C:\Program Files\depends* and *C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS*.

Restart MeVisLab and open Project Wizard again. All required tools should now be available.

### Use MeVisLab Project Wizard to Generate the Installer
Select your macro module and the package and click *Next*.

![Welcome](images/tutorials/summary/Example5_3.png "Welcome")

The general settings dialog allows you to define a name for your application. You can also define a version, in our case, we decide not to be finished and have a version *0.5*. You can include debug files and decide to build a desktop or web application. We want to build an *Application Installer* for a desktop system. You can decide to precompile your Python files and you have to select your MeVisLab **MeVisLab ApplicationBuilder** license.

![General Settings](images/tutorials/summary/Example5_4.png "General Settings")

Define your license text that is shown during installation of your executable. You can decide to use our predefined text, select a custom file, or do not include any license text.

![License Text](images/tutorials/summary/Example5_5.png "License Text")

The next dialog can be skipped for now, you can include additional files into your installer that are not automatically added by MeVisLab from the dependency analysis.

![Manual File Lists](images/tutorials/summary/Example5_6.png "Manual File Lists")

Define how the window of your application shall look.

![Application Options](images/tutorials/summary/Example5_7.png "Application Options")

Skip the next dialog, we do not need additional installer options.

![Installer Options](images/tutorials/summary/Example5_8.png "Installer Options")

The MeVisLab ToolRunner starts generating your installer. After finishing installer generation, you will find a link to the target directory.

![MeVisLab ToolRunner](images/tutorials/summary/Example5_9.png "MeVisLab ToolRunner")

The directory contains the following files (and some more maybe):
* Batch (*.bat*) file
* Installer (*.exe*) file
* MeVisLab Install (*.mlinstall*) file
* Shell (*.sh*) script
* Third-party list (*.csv*)

#### Batch File
The batch file allows you to generate the executable again via a Windows batch file. You do not need the Project Wizard anymore now.

#### Installer File
The resulting installer file for your application is an executable.

#### MeVisLab Install File
The *.mlinstall* file provides all information you just entered into the wizard. We will need this in [Step 7: Refine - Re-Build Installer](tutorials/summary/summary7/) again.

The file is initially generated by the Project Wizard. Having a valid file already, you can create new versions by using the MeVisLab ToolRunner.

#### Shell Skript
The shell skript allows you to generate the executable again via a Unix shell like bash. You do not need the Project Wizard anymore now.

#### Third-party File
The third-party file contains all third-party software tools MeVisLab integrated into your installer from dependency analysis. The file contains the tool name, version, license, and general information about the tool.

### Install Your Executable
You can now execute the installer of your application.

The installer initially shows a welcome screen showing the name and version of your application.

![Installer](images/tutorials/summary/Example5_10.png "Installer")

Next, you will see your selected license agreement from the project wizard and a selection to install for anyone or just for the current user.

![License Agreement](images/tutorials/summary/Example5_11.png "License Agreement")

You can also select to create shortcuts and desktop icons.

![Shortcuts and icons](images/tutorials/summary/Example5_12.png "Shortcuts and icons")

The last step is to select the target directory for your application. 

![Target directory](images/tutorials/summary/Example5_13.png "Target directory")

After the installer finished the setup, you will find a desktop icon and a start menu entry for your application.

{{<alert class="warning" caption="Licensing">}}
MeVisLab executables require an additional **MeVisLab Runtime** license. It makes sure that your resulting application needs to be licensed, too.

Free evaluation licenses of the **MeVisLab ApplicationBuilder** and **MeVisLab Runtime** licenses for testing purposes can be requested at [sales(at)mevislab.de](mailto://sales@mevislab.de).
{{</alert>}}

![Runtime License](images/tutorials/summary/Example5_14.png "Runtime License")

After entering your license file, the application runs and you can use it on a customer system.

![Installed Application](images/tutorials/summary/Example5_15.png "Installed Application")

{{<alert class="info" caption="Info">}}
By default, your user interface uses a standard stylesheet for colors and appearance of your user interface elements. The style can be customized easily.
{{</alert>}}

## Summary
* The **MeVisLab ApplicationBuilder** allows you to create installable executables from your MeVisLab networks.
* The resulting application can be customized to your needs via the Project Wizard.
* Your application will be licensed separately so that you can completely control the usage.
