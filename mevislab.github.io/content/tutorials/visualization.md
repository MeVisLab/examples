# Visualization in MeVisLab {#TutorialVisualization}
## Introduction

Images and data objects can be rendered in 2D and 3D and interacted with in several ways using a set of tools available through MeVisLab. 
In this chapter in particular, we will focus on simple image interaction with two- and three-dimensional visualizations. 

{{<alert class="info" caption="Info">}}
Not only pixel- and voxel-based data, but also scene objects and 3D scenes can be visualized. See our tutorial on [OpenInventorModules](/tutorials/openinventor#TutorialOpenInventorModules) for further information.

## View2D and View3D

An easy way to display data and images in 2D and 3D is by using the Modules `View2D` and `View3D`. What can be done with these viewers?

### View2D

1. Scroll through the slices using the mouse wheel {{< mousebutton "middle" >}}  and/or middle mouse button {{< mousebutton "middle" >}}.

2. Change the contrast of the image by clicking the right mouse button {{< mousebutton "right" >}} and move the mouse

3. Zoom in and out by pressing {{< keyboard "CTRL" >}} and middle mouse button {{< mousebutton "middle" >}}

4. Toggle between multiple timepoints (if available) via {{< keyboard "ArrowLeft" >}} and {{< keyboard "ArrowRight" >}}

5. More features can be found on the help page.

The `View2DExtensions` module provides additional ways to interact with an image. ![View2DExtensions](/images/tutorials/visualization/V0a.png "View2DExtensions")

### View3D

1. Zoom in and out using the mouse wheel {{< mousebutton "middle" >}}

2. Drag the 3D objects using the middle mouse button {{< mousebutton "middle" >}}

3. Change the contrast of the image by clicking the right mouse button {{< mousebutton "right" >}} and moving the mouse

4. Rotate the object by pressing the left mouse button {{< mousebutton "left" >}} and moving the object around. The present orientation is displayed by a cube in the bottom right corner.

5. More features, like recording movies, can be found on the help page.

6. Toggle between multiple timepoints (if available) via {{< keyboard "ArrowLeft" >}} and {{< keyboard "ArrowRight" >}}
