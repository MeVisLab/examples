# Surface Example 3: Interactions with WEM

{{< youtube "YDOEqCOmUFw">}}

## Introduction
In these examples, we are showing 2 different possibilities to interact with a WEM:
* Scale, rotate and move a WEM in a scene
* Modify a WEM in a scene

### Scale, rotate and move a WEM in a scene
We are using a `SoTransformerDragger` module to apply transformations on a 3D WEM object via mouse interactions.

Add a `SoCube` and a `SoBackground` module and connect both to a `SoExaminerViewer`. For a better understanding, you should also add a `SoCoordinateSystem` module and connect it to the viewer. Change the *User Transform Mode* to *User Transform Instead Of Input* and set *User Scale* to 2 for *x*, *y* and *z*.

![Initial Network](/images/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaces/WEMExample3_1.png "Initial Network")

The `SoExaminerViewer` shows your cube and the world coordinate system. You can interact with the camera (rotate, zoom and pan), the cube itself does not change and remains in the center of the coordinate system.

![Initial Cube](/images/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaces/WEMExample3_2.png "Initial Cube")

Scaling, rotation and translations on the cube itself can be done by using the module `SoTransformerDragger`. Additionally add a `SoTransform` module to your network. Add all modules but the `SoCoordinateSystem` to a `SoSeparator` so that transformations are not applied to the coordinate system.

![SoTransformerDragger and SoTransform](/images/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaces/WEMExample3_3.png "SoTransformerDragger and SoTransform")

Draw parameter connections from *Translation*, *Scale Factor* and *Rotation* of the `SoTransformerDragger` to the same fields of the `SoTransform` module.

Opening your SoExaminerViewer now allows you to use handles of the `SoTransformerDragger` to scale, rotate and move the cube. You can additionally interact with the camera as already done before.

{{<alert class="info" caption="Info">}}
You need to change the active tool on the right side of the `SoExaminerViewer`. Use the *Pick Mode* for applying transformations and the *View Mode* for using the camera.

You can also try the other `So*Dragger` modules in MeVisLab for variations of the `SoTransformerDragger`.

### Interactively modify WEMs
We are using the `WEMBulgeEditor` module to interactively modify the WEM via mouse interactions.

Add a `WEMInitialize`, a `SoWEMRenderer` and a `SoBackground` module to your workspace and connect them to a `SoExaminerViewer` as seen below. Select model *Icosahedron* for the `WEMInitialize` module.

![WEMLoad and SoWEMRenderer](/images/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaces/WEMExample3_5.png "WEMLoad and SoWEMRenderer")

You can see the WEM and interact with it in the viewer (zoom, move and rotate). In case the object does not rotate around its center, trigger the field *viewAll* of the `SoExaminerViewer`.

Add a `WEMBulgeEditor` and a `SoWEMBulgeEditor` to your network and connect them as seen below. 

![WEMBulgeEditor and SoWEMBulgeEditor](/images/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaces/WEMExample3_6.png "WEMBulgeEditor and SoWEMBulgeEditor")

Opening the viewer, you can still not edit the object.

We need a lookup table (LUT) to interact with the WEM. Add a `WEMGenerateStatistics` between the WEMInitialize and the WEMBulgeEditor. The module `WEMGenerateStatistics` generates node, edge, and face statistics of a WEM and stores the information in the WEM's Primitive Value Lists.

{{<alert class="info" caption="Info">}}
More information about Primitive Value Lists (PVL) can be found in [Surface Example 5](/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaces/surfaceexample5).
{{</alert>}}

Check *New node PVL* and set *New PVL Name* to *myPVL*.

![WEMGenerateStatistics](/images/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaces/WEMExample3_7.png "WEMGenerateStatistics")

In the `WEMBulgeEditor`, set *PVL Used as LUT Values* to previously generated *myPVL*.

![WEMBulgeEditor PVL](/images/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaces/WEMExample3_8.png "WEMBulgeEditor PVL")

Add a `SoLUTEditor` and connect it to `SoWEMRenderer`. You also have to connect the `WEMGenerateStatistics` to the `SoWEMRenderer`. Set `SoWEMRenderer` *Color Mode* to *Lut Values* and select *PVL Used as LUT Values* to *myPVL*.

![Final Network](/images/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaces/WEMExample3_10.png "Final Network")

Open the panel of the `SoLUTEditor`. Configure *New Range Min* as -1 and *New Range Max* as 1 in *Range* tab. Apply the new range. Define the LUT as seen below in *Editor* tab.

![SoLUTEditor](/images/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaces/WEMExample3_9.png "SoLUTEditor")

Now your Primitive Value List is used to colorize the affected region for your tansformations. You can see the region by the color on hovering the mouse over the WEM.

![Affected region colored](/images/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaces/Affected_Region.png "Affected region colored")

The size of the region can be changed via {{<keyboard "ALT" >}} and mouse wheel {{< mousebutton "middle" >}}. Make sure that the *Influence Radius* in `WEMBulgeEditor` is larger than 0.

{{<alert class="info" caption="Info">}}
You need to change the active tool on the right side of the `SoExaminerViewer`. Use the *Pick Mode* for applying transformations and the *View Mode* for using the camera.
{{</alert>}}

![Modify WEM](/images/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaces/Modify.png "Modify WEM")

{{< networkfile "examples/data_objects/surface_objects/example3/WEMExample3b.mlab" >}}

A much more complex example using medical images and allowing to modify in 3D and on 2D slices can be seen by opening the example network of the `WEMBulgeEditor`.

![WEMBulgeEditor Example Network](/images/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaces/WEMExample3_11.png "WEMBulgeEditor Example Network")

{{<alert class="info" caption="Info">}}
For other interaction possibilities, you can play around with the example networks of the modules `SoCSODrawOnSurface`, `SoVolumeCutting` and `WEMExtrude`.
{{</alert>}}

## Summary
* MeVisLab provides multiple options to interact with 3D surfaces.
* Modules of the `So*Dragger` family allow to scale, rotate and translate a WEM.
* You can always use a `SoCoordinateSystem` to see the current world coordinates.
* The `WEMBulgeEditor` allows you to interactively modify a WEM via mouse.
