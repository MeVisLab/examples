# Example 1.1: MeVisLab Coordinate Systems
Coordinate systems in MeVisLab are always [right handed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule).

Three coordinate systems exist next to each other:
* World coordinates
* Voxel coordinates
* Device coordinates

The blue rectangle shows the same region in the three coordinate systems.

## World coordinates
World coordinates are:
* Global: Combine several objects in a view
* Absolute: Measure distances and angles
* Isotropic: All directions are equivalent
* Orthogonal: Coordinate axes are orthogonal to each other

The origin of the world coordinate system can be anywhere and is not clearly defined. All other coordinates are relative to the origin of the world coordinates.

### World coordinates in MeVisLab
You can show the world coordinates in MeVisLab by using the following example network:

![World Coordinates in MeVisLab](/images/tutorials/basicmechanics/WorldCoordinates.png "World Coordinates in MeVisLab")

The `ConstantImage` module generates an artificial image with a certain size, data type and a constant fill value. The image is located directly at the origin of the world coordinate system, therefore the `SoCoordinateSystem` module shows the world coordinate system.

Placing an object into the Open Inventor Scene of the `SoExaminerViewer`, in this case a `SoCube` with *width*, *height* and *depth* of 10, places the object to the origin of the world coordinate system.

### Translations
You can move an object in your scene using a `SoTranslation` module for example. Update your network and add the module before your cube. Defining a translation vector 50, 0, 0 moves your cube by 50 in x-direction based on the origin of the world coordinate system.

### Transformations
More complex transformations can be done by using the `SoTransform` module. You can not only translate an existing object but also rotate, scale and many other transformations.

## Voxel coordinates
Voxel coordinates are:
* Relative to an image
* Dependent on voxel spacing
* Continuous from [0..x,0..y,0..z], voxel center at 0.5
* Often non-isotropic, sometimes non-orthogonal
* Direct relation to voxel location in memory

### Voxel coordinates in MeVisLab
You can show the voxel coordinates in MeVisLab by using the following example network:

![Voxel Coordinates](/images/tutorials/basicmechanics/VoxelCoordinates.png "Voxel Coordinates")

Load the file *Liver1_CT_venous.small.tif* .The `Info` module shows detailed information about the image loaded by the `LocalImage`. Opening the `SoExaminerViewer` shows the voxel coordinate system of the loaded image. You might have to change the LUT in `SoGVRVolumeRenderer` so that the image looks better.

![Voxel coordinates of the loaded image](/images/tutorials/basicmechanics/SoExaminerViewer_Voxel.png "Voxel coordinates of the loaded image")

The *Advanced* tab of the `Info` module shows the world coordinates of the image. In this case, the origin of the voxel coordinate system is located at -186.993, -173.993, -249.993.

In addition to that, you can see a scaling which has been done on the image. The voxel sizes are shown in the diagonal values of the matrix as 3.985792, 3.985792, 3.985798.

![World coordinates of the loaded image](/images/tutorials/basicmechanics/ImageInfo_Advanced.png "World coordinates of the loaded image")

You can change the scaling to 1 by adding a `Resample3D` module to the network, Set the voxel size to 1, 1, 1 and inspect the `Info` module.

![Resample3D](/images/tutorials/basicmechanics/Resample3D.png "Resample3D")

![Image Info after Resampling](/images/tutorials/basicmechanics/ImageInfo_AdvancedResampled.png "Image Info after Resampling")

The voxel size is now 1.

You can add this network to the world coordinate system network developed above and see both coordinate systems.

![World coordinates of the loaded image](/images/tutorials/basicmechanics/WorldVoxelNetwork.png "World coordinates of the loaded image")

Opening the `SoExaminerViewer` shows the world coordinate system in white and the voxel coordinate system in yellow.

![World and Voxel coordinates](/images/tutorials/basicmechanics/SoExaminerViewer_both.png "World and Voxel coordinates")

On the yellow axis, we can see that the coordinate systems are located as already seen in the `Info` module *Advanced* tab. On the x-axis, the voxel coordinate origin is translated by -186.993 and on the y-axis by -173.993.

You can also add a `SoVertexProperty` and a `SoLineSet` module and configure a line from the origin of the world coordinate system 0, 0, 0 to the origin of the voxel coordinate system as defined by the image -186.993, -173.993, -249.993.

## Device coordinates
Device coordinates are:
* 2D coordinates in OpenGL viewport
* Measured in pixel
* Have their origin (0,0) in the top left corner of the device (with x-coordinates increasing to the right and y-coordinates increasing downwards)

The viewport is the rectangle in pixels on your screen you want to render to. Affine transformations map abstract coordinates from your scene to physical pixels on your device.

All triangular vertices go through a projection matrix and end in a normalized range from -1 to 1 representing your field of view. To find which pixels the triangles actually cover on screen, those coordinates get linearly remapped from [âˆ’1, 1] to the range of the viewport rectangle in pixels. Technically that kind of mapping is called an [*affine transformation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation).
