# Example 4: 3D Plotting

## Introduction 

In this tutorial, we will equip the macro module we created in the [Example 1: Module Setup](/tutorials/thirdparty/matplotlib/modulesetup) and later on adapted by enabling it to plot grayscale distributions of single slices and sequences in 2D in [Example 2: 2D Plotting](/tutorials/thirdparty/matplotlib/2dplotting) with a three dimensional plotting functionality. 

## Steps to do 

The fields and commands needed have already been prepared in the second tutorial. We will just have to modify our .py file a little to make them usable.
