# Example 3: Slice Comparison

## Introduction 

We will adapt the previously created macro module to be able to overlay two defined slices to compare their grayscale distributions. 
+ The module we are adapting has been set up in the [Example 1: Module Setup](/tutorials/thirdparty/matplotlib/modulesetup) tutorial.
+ The panel and two dimensional plotting functionality has been added in [Example 2: 2D Plotting](/tutorials/thirdparty/matplotlib/2dplotting).

## Steps to do
At first, we will extend the panel: Open your `BaseNetwork` macro module within an empty MeVisLab workspace and select the .script file from its related files.
