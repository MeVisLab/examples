# Example 1: 3D Printing in MeVisLab

## Introduction
This example uses the assimp library to load a 3D file and save the file as \*.stl for 3D printing.

## Steps to do
### Develop your network
Add the modules `SoSceneLoader`, `SoBackground` and `SoExaminerViewer` to your workspace and connect them as seen below.

### Open the 3D file
Select the file *vtkCow.obj* from MeVisLab demo data directory. Open `SoExaminerViewer` and inspect the scene. You will see a 3D cow.

In case you cannot see the cow, it might be located outside your current camera location. Trigger the field *rescanScene* in case the cow is not visible.
{{</alert>}}

Add a `SoSphere` to the workspace and connect it to your viewer. Define the *Radius* of your sphere to 2 and inspect your viewer.

You can also define a material for your sphere but what we wanted to show is: You can use the loaded 3D files in MeVisLab Open Inventor Scenes.

### Save your scene as \*.stl file for 3D Printing
Add a `SoSceneWriter` module to your workspace. The `SoExaminerViewer` has a hidden output which can be shown on pressing {{<keyboard "SPACE">}}. Connect the `SoSceneWriter` to the output.

Name your output \*.stl file and select *Stl Ascii* as output format so that we can inspect the result afterwards.

{{<alert class="info" caption="Info">}}
The `SoSceneWriter` can save node color information when saving in Inventor (ASCII or binary) or in VRML format. The `SoSceneWriter` needs to be attached to a `SoWEMRenderer` that renders in *ColorMode:NodeColor*.

There are [tools](https://www.patrickmin.com/meshconv/) to convert from at least VRML to STL available for free.

Write your Scene and open the resulting file in your preferred editor. As an alternative, you can also open the file in an \*.stl file reader like Microsoft 3D-Viewer.

### Load the file again
For loading your \*.stl file, you can use a `SoSceneLoader` and a `SoExaminerViewer`.

More information about the \*.stl format can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format))

## Summary
* MeVisLab is able to load and write many different 3D file formats including *.stl format for 3D Printing.
* Inventor Scenes can be saved by using a `SoExaminerViewer` together with a `SoSceneWriter`
