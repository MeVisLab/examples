# PyTorch {#pytorch}
## Introduction
[PyTorch](http://www.pytorch.org "pytorch") is a machine learning framework based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, originally developed by Meta AI and now part of the Linux Foundation umbrella.

There are many other AI frameworks which can be used in MeVisLab. None of them is completely integrated into MeVisLab, because they are changing very fast and we cannot keep the latest versions compatible to MeVisLab.

Some alternatives are:
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org "tensorflow")
* [Keras](https://keras.io "Keras")
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org "scikit-learn")

## Available Tutorials
### Install PyTorch by using the PythonPip module
The first example shows how to install *torch* and *torchvision* by using the MeVisLab module `PythonPip`. This module can be used to install Python packages not integrated into MeVisLab.
