# MONAI {#monai}
## Introduction
[MONAI](https://github.com/Project-MONAI "monai") (**M**edical **O**pen **N**etwork for **AI**) is an open-source framework built on [PyTorch](http://www.pytorch.org "pytorch"), designed for developing and deploying AI models in medical imaging.

Created by [NVIDIA](https://docs.nvidia.com/monai/index.html "NVIDIA") and the Linux Foundation, it provides specialized tools for handling medical data formats like DICOM and NIfTI, along with advanced preprocessing, augmentation, and 3D image analysis capabilities.

MONAI includes ready-to-use deep learning models (such as UNet and SegResNet) and utilities for segmentation, classification, and image registration. It supports distributed GPU training and ensures reproducible research workflows.
