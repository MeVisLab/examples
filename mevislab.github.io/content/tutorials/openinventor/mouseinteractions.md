# Example 2: Mouse interactions in Open Inventor {#TutorialVisualizationExample5}

{{< youtube "Ye5lOHDWcRo" >}}

## Introduction
In this example, we implement some image or object interactions. We will create a 3D scene, in which we display a cube and change its size using the mouse. We also get to know another viewer, the module `SoExaminerViewer`. This viewer is important. It enables the rendering of Open Inventor scenes and allows interactions with the Open Inventor scenes.

## Steps to do
### Develop your network
For implementing the example, build the following network. We already know the module `SoCube`, which builds a 3D scene object forming a cube. In addition to that, add the module `SoMouseGrabber`. Connect the modules as shown below.

Additional information about the `SoMouseGrabber` can be found here: {{< docuLinks "/Standard/Documentation/Publish/ModuleReference/SoMouseGrabber.html#top" "SoMouseGrabber">}}

### Configure mouse interactions
Now, open the panels of the module `SoMouseGrabber` and the module `SoExaminerViewer`, which displays a cube. In the Viewer, press the right key of your mouse {{< mousebutton "right" >}} and move the mouse around. This action can be seen in the panel of the module SoMouseGrabber.

Make sure to configure `SoMouseGrabber` fields as seen below.

**You can see:**
1. *Button 3*, the right mouse button {{< mousebutton "right" >}}, is tagged as being pressed
2. Changes of the mouse coordinates are displayed in the box *Output*.

### Resize cube via mouse interactions

We like to use the detected mouse-movements to change the size of our cube. In order to that, open the panel of `SoCube`. Build parameter connections from the mouse coordinates to the width and depth of the cube.

If you now press the right mouse key {{< mousebutton "right" >}} inside the Viewer and move the mouse around, the size of the cube changes.

## Exercises
1. Change location of the cube via Mouse Interactions by using the Module `SoTransform`
1. Add more objects to the scene and interact with them

## Summary
* The module `SoExaminerViewer` enables the rendering of Open Inventor scenes and allows interactions with the Open Inventor scenes.
* Mouse interactions can be applied to the objects in the scene.
