# Example 4: Post Effects in Open Inventor
Up to this point, we learned to construct Open Inventor scenes and placed three-dimensional Open Inventor objects of different colors and shapes within them.
In this tutorial, we will go over the steps to add shadows to our 3D-objects, make them glow and vary their opacity to make them transparent. Lastly, we will incorporate DICOM data as a scene object and see how different post effects can be used on them.
