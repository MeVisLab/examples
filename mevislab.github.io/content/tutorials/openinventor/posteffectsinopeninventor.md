# Example 4: Post Effects in Open Inventor
## Introduction

Up to this point, we practiced constructing Open Inventor scenes and placed three-dimensional Open Inventor objects of different colors and shapes within them.
In this tutorial, we will go over the steps to add shadows to our 3D-objects, make them glow and vary their opacity to make them transparent. We will also incorporate WEMs from multi-frame DICOMs and render them as scene objects to see how different post effects can be used on them.

## Steps to follow

### From DICOM to scene object

To incorporate DICOMs into your Open Inventor Scene, they have to be rendered as Open Inventor objects, which can be done through converting them into [WEMs](/glossary/#winged-edge-meshes) first:
