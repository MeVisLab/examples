Differences between these types are explained in the following chapters and example networks are built to learn how to use them.
Examples: Contours Surface Objects Markers</description></item><item><title>Surface Example 1: Creation of WEMs</title><link>https://mevislab.github.io/examples/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaces/surfaceexample1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2022 08:56:33 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://mevislab.github.io/examples/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaces/surfaceexample1/</guid><description>Surface Example 1: Create Winged Edge Mesh out of voxel-images and CSOs Introduction In this example you will learn how to create Winged Edge Mesh (WEM). There are several ways how to create WEMs, a few of them are shown in this example. Instead of creating WEMs, it is also possible to load existing WEMs. This was already shown in Surface Objects (WEM) chapter.
Steps to do From image to surface: Generating WEMs out of voxel images At first, we will create a WEM out of a voxel image using the module WEMIsoSurface.</description></item><item><title>Surface Example 2: Processing and Modification of WEM</title><link>https://mevislab.github.io/examples/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaces/surfaceexample2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2022 08:56:33 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://mevislab.github.io/examples/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaces/surfaceexample2/</guid><description>Surface Example 2: Processing and Modification of WEM Introduction In this example, you will learn how to modify and process WEMs.
Steps to do Develop your network Modification of WEMs Use the module WEMLoad to load the file venus.off. Than add and connect the shown modules. We like to display the WEM venus two times, one time this WEM is modified. You can use the module WEMModify to apply modifications. In its panel, change the scale and the size of the WEM.</description></item><item><title>Surface Example 3: Interactions with WEM</title><link>https://mevislab.github.io/examples/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaces/surfaceexample3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2022 08:56:33 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://mevislab.github.io/examples/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaces/surfaceexample3/</guid><description>Surface Example 3: Interactions with WEM Introduction In this example, we like to create networks, which enable interactive manipulations of WEMs inside a viewer. We will build a network to draw on WEMs and use this network to enable to cut WEMs.

Develop your network Interactively translating objects in 3D using SoDragger modules Add and connect the following modules as shown. In the panel of the module WEMInitialize select the Model Octasphere. After that, open the viewer SoExaminerViewer and make sure to select the Interaction Mode. Now, you are able to click on the presented Octaspehere and move it alongside one axis.</description></item><item><title>Surface Example 5: WEM - Primitive Value Lists</title><link>https://mevislab.github.io/examples/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaces/surfaceexample5/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2022 08:56:33 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://mevislab.github.io/examples/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaces/surfaceexample5/</guid><description>Surface Example 5: WEM - Primitive Value Lists Introduction WEMs do not only contain the coordinates of nodes and surfaces, they can also contain additional information. These information are stored in so called Primitive Value Lists (PVLs). Every node, every surface and every edge can contains such a list. In these lists, you can for example store the color of the node or specific patient information. These information can be used for visualization or for further statistical analysis.</description></item><item><title>Surface Objects (WEM)</title><link>https://mevislab.github.io/examples/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaceobjects/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2022 08:56:33 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://mevislab.github.io/examples/tutorials/dataobjects/surfaceobjects/</guid><description>Surface Objects (WEMs) Introduction In MeVisLab it is possible to create, visualize, process and manipulate surface objects, also known as polygon meshes. Here, we call surface objects Winged Edge Mesh, in short WEM. In this chapter you will get an introduction into WEMs. In addition, you will find examples on how to work with WEMs. For more information on WEMs take a look at the MeVislab Toolbox Reference . If you like to know which WEM formats can be imported into MeVisLab, take a look at the assimp documentation here.</description></item></channel></rss>
